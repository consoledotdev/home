        <h4 class="title title-3">1 / Free inclusion and review</h4>
        <p class="intro">
            Each week, Console reviews 2-3 interesting tools that we recommend to our subscribers. Subscribers trust and value our recommendations. We do not take payment for inclusion and do not charge to consider a product.

        <h4 class="title title-3">2 / Editorially independent</h4>
        <p class="intro">
            Reviews are editorially independent and partners do not get to read the review before it is published. Only the best tools make it and our readers know that if a tool is featured, it’s worth trying out. This means that we only include tools that meet our selection criteria.

        <h4 class="title title-3">3 / Focused advertising</h4>
        <p class="intro">
            The packages below are only available once we have completed a successful review. Each campaign is unique, built from the ground up for every partner. This is not generic advertising - we put you in front of experienced developers specifically looking to try new tools. If you are interested in either package, please get in touch so we can prioritize the evaluation of your product.

We're creating a new product category, which is a complicated category, so it makes it challenging to break it down to developers and explain it to them. So we want to be in media, like Console, where developers are interested in learning new things. Working with Console, we were able to provide the extra context that enabled us to convey how Oso can help. We were able to sync our launch dates and coordinate an interview with our CTO to provide a primer on the vision, but also deeplink to our developer docs. This helped us maximize impact for the launch and reach thousands of developers in the right way.”</span>
