                    Slim.AI is a container analysis and comparison tool. Slim.AI approached Console to help sign-up early adopters to their developer platform. Console worked with their growth team to maximise exposure to our audience by offering unique invite codes to incentivize developers.

                        “Our campaign with Console was very successful. We saw x5 our usual daily rate of acquisition both on the day of the newsletter and in the following days. The best thing was how qualified the audience was. We saw new people join our Discord community and start engaging, something we rarely see through more traditional paid sources. We even had a new application for an engineering position as a result of seeing the interview. Console really helped us reach exactly the audience we wanted.”

We're creating a new product category, which is a complicated category, so it makes it challenging to break it down to developers and explain it to them. So we want to be in media, like Console, where developers are interested in learning new things. Working with Console, we were able to provide the extra context that enabled us to convey how Oso can help. We were able to sync our launch dates and coordinate an interview with our CTO to provide a primer on the vision, but also deeplink to our developer docs. This helped us maximize impact for the launch and reach thousands of developers in the right way.”
