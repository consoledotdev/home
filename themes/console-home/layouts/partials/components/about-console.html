        <p class="small"><span class="console-name">Console</span> is the place developers go to find the best tools. Each week, our weekly newsletter picks out the most interesting tools and new releases. We keep track of everything - dev tools, devops, cloud, and APIs - so you don’t have to.</p>
        <p class="small">Our recommendations are made through years of experience and research, bringing a deep practical understanding of the needs of experienced developers. We pride ourselves on being transparent in our editorial approach. It’s our job to do the filtering, so you can stay up-to-date with the tools that matter, and focus on what you do best.</p>
