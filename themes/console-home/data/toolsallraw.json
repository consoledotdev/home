Uses Go template language for managing input and output. Supports Docker wrappers to bootstrap environments. Includes a drop-in GCC/clang replacement for outsourcing compilation.","What we dislike":"Lambda is CPU and memory constrained, and the network is a bottleneck, so use cases are constrained to where parallelization makes a big difference (or there is a benefit to freeing local resources).","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Typesense","Tool/Product/Project":"Typesense","Reviewed":"2021-03-24","Scheduled for":"2021-04-08","URL":"https://typesense.org","Category":"Developer Tools - Site Search","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Fast, typo-tolerant search engine.","Len":"156","What we like":"Single binary (C++) runs natively on Linux and macOS. Tunable ranking for relevancy score tie-breaks. Sort at query-time without additional indexes. Scoped API keys. InstantSearch.js adapter. REST API with clients for JS, PHP, Python, Ruby. Open source + cloud option.","What we dislike":"Need to build your own index updater mechanism to process new data. API-only means you need to build your own UI/admin. Only supports Latin-based languages.","Interview":"/interviews/typesense-jason-bosco/","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Svix","Tool/Product/Project":"Svix","Reviewed":"2021-04-05","Scheduled for":"2021-04-08","URL":"https://www.svix.com/","Category":"DevOps - API Management","Type":"SaaS","What is it?":"Webhook infrastructure as a service.","Len":"119","What we like":"Offering webhooks is actually more complex than you'd expect. Diahook deals with signing requests, queueing, retries, reliability, auth, E2E encryption, rate limiting, logs and debugging.","What we dislike":"You need to send your events to Diahook, which means you still need to ensure they get there (retries, debugging, etc).","Interview":"/interviews/svix-tom-hacohen/","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Temporal","Tool/Product/Project":"Temporal","Reviewed":"2021-03-16","Scheduled for":"2021-04-01","URL":"https://temporal.io/","Category":"Developer Tools - Workflow management","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Framework for workflow orchestration.","Len":"161","What we like":"Deals with the underlying infrastructure for reliable task execution: state management, retries, scaling, fault tolerance. Avoid building and running your own timers / queues - just write the function business logic. Open source server you can run yourself, or use their cloud option (in private beta).","What we dislike":"SDKs are still being built out (currently available for Go, Java, PHP, Ruby). You still need to run / scale your own database (Cassandra, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).

Includes in-memory database for persistence tests. Can simulate slow responses or errors. Built-in ORM handles data relationships, output formatting, serialization.","What we dislike":"Only supports REST APIs out of the box - GraphQL available as an optional plugin (still in development). Runs in the browser, not as a server, so it cannot be used to mock server-side APIs.","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"git-plan","Tool/Product/Project":"git-plan","Reviewed":"2021-03-30","Scheduled for":"2021-04-01","URL":"https://github.com/synek/git-plan","Category":"Developer Tools - Git tools","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Git workflow for planning / writing commits in advance.","Len":"206","What we like":"Forces you to think about what you are going to work on in advance - writing out a plan probably helps improve your thinking, and also creates better commit messages. If you think of something you need to switch to, you can create a plan whilst it’s still top-of-mind, then come back to it later.","What we dislike":"Unintuitive to begin with, but makes sense once you try it (see blog posts linked in the project readme for guidance).

Configurable editor e.g. use vim keybindings, tabs vs spaces, etc.","What we dislike":"Can be slow to execute (many seconds) especially with lots of steps.
