Web dashboard summarizes deploy status. Extensible hooks via plugins.","What we dislike":"Assumes your app is containerized. Need to run / maintain your own Waypoint server - still early so not entirely prod-ready. Preview URLs are public so you must set up authorization or disable them (self-hosting URL service is an option, but complex).","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Zellij","Tool/Product/Project":"Zellij","Reviewed":"2021-06-14","Scheduled for":"2021-07-08","URL":"https://zellij.dev/","Category":"Misc - Terminal emulators","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Terminal workspace manager (tabs + multiplexing).","Len":"244","What we like":"Built-in tabs, panes, sessions, resizing, scrollback. Shows (customizable) keybindings to help discovery. “New pane” algorithmically placed in the most optimized position (or use manual splits). Can configure layouts in yaml then auto start them. Single compiled binary. Has a built-in file manager (a clone of ranger). WASM-based plugin system.","What we dislike":"Colors not inherited from existing shell config. Docs are still very limited. Some core shortcuts used by other tools e.g. Ctrl + r in bash (use Zellij lock mode to pass these through). Slightly laggy over remote connections (compared to tmux).","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Prestige","Tool/Product/Project":"Prestige","Reviewed":"2021-06-17","Scheduled for":"2021-07-01","URL":"https://prestigemad.com/","Category":"Developer Tools - API Client","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Browser- and text-based HTTP client.","Len":"135","What we like":"Really simple way to execute HTTP commands but can also send more complex requests e.g. headers, file uploads, cookies, JSON. Can write commands in plain text, JS, or define variables in templates. Prettified and syntax-highlighted response parsing. Can save to local browser storage (GitHub and others on roadmap). Open source codebase.","What we dislike":"Requests run through a proxy rather than your browser (due to CORS), but localhost URLs are routed directly. No support for OAuth APIs.","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"chezmoi","Tool/Product/Project":"chezmoi","Reviewed":"2021-06-17","Scheduled for":"2021-07-01","URL":"https://www.chezmoi.io/","Category":"Misc - Terminal utilities","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"dotfile manager.","Len":"266","What we like":"Single compiled binary. No bootstrap requirements - supports many platforms. Can query password manager for secrets and supports encrypted files. Configs can be templated for differences across environments. Can run scripts, including run-once (ideal for cloud IDEs or ephemeral environments). File edit flow similar to git (which is used for versioning).","What we dislike":"You can edit files directly but using the edit flow ensures changes/conflicts are handled properly, which may require retraining muscle memory. Doesn’t handle git subdirectories e.g. Oh My Zsh particularly well (better to use a script to install outside of chezmoi).","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"IPInfo","Tool/Product/Project":"IPInfo","Reviewed":"2021-06-07","Scheduled for":"2021-06-24","URL":"https://ipinfo.io","Category":"API - API","Type":"SaaS","What is it?":"CLI for IP address metadata lookup.","Len":"108","What we like":"Lookup IP details such as ASN, location, hostname, abuse contact, tor/VPN/hosting IP categorization. Cross-platform binaries. Colored output. Bulk summarize IPs from a file (or piped in). Bash, zsh, fish auto-completion. SDKs available for major languages.","What we dislike":"Responses not cached.

Keyboard control of common tasks e.g. stash, stage, diff review and commit with keybindings highlighted for newer users (or when you forget). Adopts terminal color scheme.

Preview live diffs and get warnings about conflicts from other collaborators. Privacy option to stop sharing when required. Built-in video calls and codesharing which works across IDEs - VS Code, JetBrains, Android Studio.","What we dislike":"Requires everyone to use GitLive and one of the supported editors.
