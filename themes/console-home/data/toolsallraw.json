Add new fields, run aggregations, colorized, tabular pretty-print. Operates with streams so only a single record is in memory at one time (unless needed for certain operations like sort) i.e. minimal footprint. Single binary (Golang, open source) with packages for Windows, Linux, macOS.","What we dislike":"Uses its own color scheme rather than inheriting current shell profile. Lots of power in the Miller DSL and the built-in command verbs can do a lot, but it’s another programming language to use for custom transformations.","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Swimm","Tool/Product/Project":"Swimm","Reviewed":"2022-01-19","Scheduled for":"2022-01-20","URL":"https://swimm.io/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=paid_refferal&utm_campaign=console.dev","Category":"Developer Tools - Documentation","Type":"SaaS","What is it?":"Documentation as code.","Len":"186","What we like":"Docs live as Markdown in the code repo. Smart editor links snippets and references even through refactors, moves, renames, etc. Plugin for VS Code and JetBrains editors to render docs in-line/. Integrate with CI (or Git hooks) to get PR comments and a quick edit link when docs need updating.","What we dislike":"CLI can be run in any CI/CD environment, but the GitHub app gives much faster feedback as PR comments (other integrations on the roadmap). Any existing docs need to be imported manually.","Interview":"/interviews/swimm-omer-rosenbaum/","Sponsored":"TRUE"},{"Company/Org":"Cube","Tool/Product/Project":"Cube","Reviewed":"2022-01-19","Scheduled for":"2022-01-20","URL":"https://cube.dev/","Category":"API - API","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"API for building analytics.","Len":"148","What we like":"Provides an HTTP API with caching, pre-aggregation and SQL support on top of popular datastores e.g. Postgres, Redshift, BigQuery. Visualization libraries provided for D3, Vue, Angular, React. Local “playground” UI makes it easy to debug queries. Open source (including cluster mode for scaling). Optional cloud version.","What we dislike":"Caching can’t be disabled and requires Redis in prod, but the refresh time can be set to a low value e.g. 1s.
