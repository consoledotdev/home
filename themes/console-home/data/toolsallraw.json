Pre/post execution hooks. Compare/diff before execution. Open source.","What we dislike":"Packages exist for Linux, but installed via pip3 on Mac. Needs manually adding to $PATH.","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Zed","Tool/Product/Project":"Zed","Reviewed":"2022-05-18","Scheduled for":"2022-05-19","URL":"https://zed.brimdata.io/","Category":"Misc - Terminal utilities","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Tooling for structured data","Len":"137","What we like":"Like jq, but easier to learn. Default behavior is to search rather than transform. Uses ZSON as output by default, which is like JSON but typed. ZSON can be converted to binary or columnar formats for large datasets. Can manipulate data with iterators, count, aggregations, conditionals, sorting, etc. Open source.","What we dislike":"It’s another language to learn, but the defaults mean you can transition from JSON and jq relatively easily (ZSON is a superset of JSON).","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Slim.AI","Tool/Product/Project":"Slim.AI","Reviewed":"2022-05-11","Scheduled for":"2022-05-12","URL":"https://www.slim.ai/","Category":"DevOps - Containers","Type":"SaaS","What is it?":"Container optimization.","Len":"147","What we like":"Generates significantly smaller images (example Nuxt app container slimmed from 1.3GB to 122MB). Performs static analysis and runs health checks against your app to ensure essential components are not removed. Config options for ensuring assets are included. Can compare slimmed images using Docker Desktop extension. Also open source as DockerSlim.","What we dislike":"No CI/CD integration - generating the slimmed container image is a manual step, but can be pushed into your own container registry once completed.\n","Interview":"","Sponsored":"TRUE"},{"Company/Org":"Oh My Posh","Tool/Product/Project":"Oh My Posh","Reviewed":"2022-05-11","Scheduled for":"2022-05-12","URL":"https://ohmyposh.dev/","Category":"Misc - Terminal utilities","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Shell prompt theme engine.","Len":"86","What we like":"Customize your shell prompt using a range of blocks e.g. clock, AWS profile, Git repo, Python venv, Spotify track etc. Supports themes, fonts, colors, icons, with lots of presets available. Config written in JSON, but also supports TOML and YAML. Supports right-aligned tooltip-like prompts for extra info. Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.","What we dislike":"Some segments can slow down rendering e.g. Spotify, which requires an external lookup.","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"EaseProbe","Tool/Product/Project":"EaseProbe","Reviewed":"2022-05-11","Scheduled for":"2022-05-12","URL":"https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe","Category":"DevOps - Observability","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Lightweight status checks.","Len":"194","What we like":"Runs HTTP, TCP, Shell, SSH, and client connection (e.g. MySQL, Kafka, Postgres) health checks, and collects hosts (CPU, memory, disk) stats. Triggers notifications via common services (Slack, email, SMS, etc). Can report SLAs. Runs as a single (Go) binary. Open source.","What we dislike":"Configured via a config file, which makes it more difficult to run distributed checks. Running your own monitoring has more overhead than you think - monitoring your monitoring, redundancy, etc.","Interview":"","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Quickwit","Tool/Product/Project":"Quickwit","Reviewed":"2022-05-04","Scheduled for":"2022-05-05","URL":"https://quickwit.io/","Category":"Developer Tools - Site Search","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Append-only search backend.","Len":"131","What we like":"Search backend optimized for large volumes of append-only data with relatively low-QPS (<10 average), most commonly logs. Data in S3 object storage which reduces cost and inherits reliability and scalability. Search instances are stateless. No GC (implemented in Rust). Open source.","What we dislike":"Not designed for mutable data or public frontends e.g. website search. Currently it only supports S3. Only supports JSON documents.","Interview":"/interviews/quickwit-paul-masurel/","Sponsored":"FALSE"},{"Company/Org":"Tekton","Tool/Product/Project":"Tekton","Reviewed":"2022-05-04","Scheduled for":"2022-05-05","URL":"https://tekton.dev/","Category":"DevOps - CI/CD","Type":"Open Source","What is it?":"Standardized cloud-native CI/CD.","Len":"110","What we like":"Runs as an extension of k8s with workloads executing inside containers, which means you can deploy CI/CD anywhere k8s runs. Scales by adding cluster nodes. Lots of community contributed tasks and pipeline components e.g. golang build or create Buildpacks. CLI is the primary UI, but also exposed via a web dashboard, kubectl, and an API.","What we dislike":"Runs as an extension of k8s, which brings all the complexity of k8s.

Sits on top of the official GitHub CLI so no need for extra auth etc. Customizable filters (using GitHub standard filter syntax). Preview description plus comments.
