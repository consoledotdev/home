      "What we like": "AWS Console UX is not great; Vantage is much cleaner and faster. It connects using a read-only CloudFormation IAM Role and they have detailed documentation about the read-only permissions it requests. \"Views\" nicely segment/group resources, even across accounts and regions, with global search for them all. Cost reporting by view and weekly email reports help you manage budgets better.",
      "What we dislike": "Does not support all AWS products, currently focused on a few key resources e.g. EC2 instances, VPC Subnets, Route53, etc. Currently read-only, which is good for security and because it's a new tool - plans to add more management features in the future. Also AWS-only, but they are working on other cloud providers.",
