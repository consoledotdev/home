Can write commands in plain text, JS, or define variables in templates. Prettified and syntax-highlighted response parsing. Can save to local browser storage (GitHub and others on roadmap). Open source codebase.", "What we dislike": "Requests run through a proxy rather than your browser (due to CORS), but localhost URLs are routed directly.

No bootstrap requirements - supports many platforms. Can query password manager for secrets and supports encrypted files. Configs can be templated for differences across environments. Can run scripts, including run-once (ideal for cloud IDEs or ephemeral environments). File edit flow similar to git (which is used for versioning).", "What we dislike": "You can edit files directly but using the edit flow ensures changes/conflicts are handled properly, which may require retraining muscle memory. Doesn\u2019t handle git subdirectories e.g. Oh My Zsh particularly well (better to use a script to install outside of chezmoi).", "Interview": "", "favicon": "img/favicons/www.chezmoi.io.png", "Top Category": "Misc", "Sub Category": "Terminal utilities", "Filter Taxonomy": "misc, open-source"}]}
