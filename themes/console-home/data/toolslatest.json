Separation of concerns with API backend (Python + GraphQL), admin dashboard, and storefront UI (TS + React) all separate projects/instances. Includes GraphQL Playground to make it easy to test API queries. CLI and SDK for custom storefront implementation, or use NextJS template. Open source or run on their cloud.", "What we dislike": "Storefront and dashboard are static, but the backend APIs need to be managed for scalability.
