            "What we like": "Helps validate files, APIs and configs e.g. k8s files. Definitions start broad e.g. types then narrow down e.g. values, so it is easy to get started, but still supports specific validations. Language is a JSON superset. Supports comments (unlike JSON!). Can extract existing definitions from Go and Protobufs.",
            "What we dislike": "Documentation explains the concepts well but is missing a \u201cfrom zero\u201d getting started tutorial (the k8s tutorial is good, though).",

            "What we like": "Stores access credentials in native OS storage e.g. Windows Credential Vault, macOS Keychain. Easy to switch between credentials e.g. AWS IAM, Azure User. Session credentials are temporary, minimizing risk of leaks and making them easy to rotate. Open source.",
            "What we dislike": "Only supports AWS and Azure. No U2F support. Supports some federated identity providers e.g. Okta, GSuite, AWS SSO, but only to AWS and Azure.",
