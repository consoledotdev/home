#### How are the teams structured?

Our CEO is acting as Head of Product. He directs the general product direction,
which features to work on, and prioritizes bugs as they happen. But other than
that it's really just everyone reviewing everyone's code, everyone can suggest
ideas, can influence the roadmap, etc.

Additionally, our core product is open source, which also influences our
thinking. We have a flat team structure, everyone is aligned with what we are
trying to do, and is committed to help the company succeed.

#### What tools do engineers use?

-   **Version control:** GitHub
-   **Project Management:** GitHub
-   **Bug tracking:** Bugsnag
-   **Communication:** Slack and Google Meet
-   **Infrastructure:** AWS
-   **Monitoring:** Cloudwatch and PagerDuty

#### Can developers pick their own tools?

Yes they can.. Some of the team is on Macs, others are on Linux. Some use VS
Code, others use Vim. There's just one small constraint - due to compliance
reasons (we're SOC 2 certified), tools need to undergo review to ensure that
they don’t put our customers, product and code at risk.

#### How does the development process work? What's the process for working through bugs, features and tech debt?

We have a sprint planning meeting once every two weeks,where we talk about the
plans for the next few months, and derive from them the plans for the next
couple of weeks (the sprint). Our customers trust us with powering their
webhooks, a customer facing and core feature of their products. We take this
trust seriously and always prioritize bugs adversely affecting customers. We
care a lot about the uptime, scalability, and the robustness of our service.
Everything else flows back from that.

#### How does code get reviewed, merged, and deployed?

As mentioned above, we take the uptime of our service, and our compliance
obligations very seriously. Every PR needs to be reviewed by at least one other
team member. In addition, sensitive parts of the code have to be reviewed by
their respective code owners. All of the code is automatically tested, linted,
and scanned using CI, and once merged it’s automatically deployed to a staging
environment.

We also run the full test suite against the real staging environment, to ensure
everything works correctly also against real infrastructure. Once the dust has
settled, approved team members can decide to promote a staging deployment to
production. We also have smoke tests that just run all the time and mimic user
behavior to make sure that everything is operational, both for staging and prod.

Deployments happen using terraform, and our dev, staging and production
environments are therefore identical, other than the amount of the minimum
provisioned resources. Everything is monitored using CloudWatch, as well as
other external tools that ensure the uptime of our services.

#### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges solved by internal teams as part of building the product?

We hold ourselves to a very high standard. This means that we can never go down,
have to be fast, have to be reliable, and have to scale with our customers’ ever
increasing scale and demands. Because of the nature of our business, every time
we onboard a large customer we have to deal with their whole scale, which can be
immense.

We are currently using a single cloud provider. Though in the long term, we want
to be in every data center in the world, to reduce latency and potential network
issues between ourselves and our customers. But for now, staying in AWS and
being multi region has worked well because, and when there's a large enough
customer, we just deploy to the same region as them - if things go bad for them,
it goes bad for us as well, so it's kind of in sync.

Within the region, we have multiple availability zones and a lot of redundancy
cross service. We use DynamoDB and Postgres, and we have fallbacks in place. If
DynamoDB is having issues, we can fall back to our backup database, for example.

One thing that we are currently working on is what we call transformations which
is essentially an embedded JavaScript engine that lets you transform webhooks
before they hit the customer endpoint. Customers can do whatever they want with
a webhook before it's sent. We use Deno and an entirely separate microservice to
ensure full isolation because you don't want environment variables or anything
like that to leak, even though Deno promises you it's not going to be the case,
you still want that double layer of protection.

#### How does on-call work?

Because we're geographically distributed, it's actually less painful than it can
be. During the week someone is always up, so it's distributed like that. The
system has been voluntary so far - people just say if they're up for it, and
when they are available.

    Hiring process at Svix
</RichTitle>

#### How does the application process work? What are the stages and what is the timeline?

It varies slightly depending on the individual. Sometimes we meet the applicant
once and we get a lot of very high signals that can shorten the process. We try
to be very transparent about our requirements and what working at Svix is like.
The process is broadly divided into following parts:

-   **Introductory call (30 mins):** Learn about background motivation and
    relevant experience.
-   **Technical interview (90 mins):** Candidates can use their own IDE with any
    extensions that might be installed for the coding interview. Though following
    feedback from candidates, we are currently exploring eliminating this and
    focusing on a take-home task instead.
-   **Take home task (2-3 hours):** Candidates can either write code for an open
    source project of their choice, or ask us to suggest a task instead, work on
    it at home, and when ready we jump on a call and discuss their work.
    Alternatively, if a candidate has made significant open source contributions,
    we can just review those instead.
-   **Team introduction:** Candidates meet the team members to ensure there is a
    mutual fit.

#### What is the career progression framework? How are promotions and performance reviews managed?

It is too early for us to have something structured (e.g. levels) for
this.Though we have weekly one-on-ones where we keep constant feedback and help
people improve. I think the team has already improved significantly since they
joined and I want that to continue.
