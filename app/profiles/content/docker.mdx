#### How are the teams structured?

We follow the methodologies outlined in [Team
Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com). Most of the teams are stream-aligned
and autonomous, including an engineering manager, product manager, product
designer, and a group of engineers. We also have supporting teams that serve our
engineering organization to ensure everyone is working on the problems they like
to solve.

#### What tools do engineers use?

-   Docker!
-   **Source Control:** GitHub
-   **Coding:** IDEs - vary by project and personal preference
-   **Coding AI:** Copilot
-   **Chat:** Slack
-   **Wiki and Knowledge Sharing:** Notion

#### Can developers pick their own tools?

Yes! We're a company that builds tools for developers, so we are very aware of
how your toolchain helps or hinders the development experience.

#### How does the development process work? What's the process for working through bugs, features and tech debt?

Teams are given high-level goals that are refined into OKRs and focus areas. The
teams are designed to be autonomous so that they can solve all kinds of
problems, from tech debt to product discovery work. What is prioritized is
determined as a group effort between both product and engineering team members.

Teams are agile and follow a rough sprint process using either weekly or
bi-weekly sprints. We don't have formal rules for how much time is spent on tech
debt vs. other work. Instead, we rely on the team leads to work this out.
Feature work can come externally from higher-level goals, learnings or ideas
that the team has, and from end users.

#### How does code get reviewed, merged, and deployed?

Development is done in Git branches. Once the code is complete, a PR is opened
which triggers CI and it's then reviewed by peers. In open source, this means
maintainers of the project and not necessarily someone at Docker.

Deployments depend on the project, but most can be deployed to a staging
environment from a feature branch or the main branch. Once the code has been
merged, production deployments can be triggered.

For projects like Desktop, there is a lot of custom code to do this as there
aren't really off-the-shelf tools for desktop applications.

#### What is the QA process?

Teams are responsible for their own QA, which is mostly handled by automation.
The team that developed the functionality does manual testing to validate new
changes and features. We also release early to our own developers so that they
can use the latest features and report if they encounter any issues.

#### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges solved by internal teams as part of building the product?

We have heard from users that their builds are slower than they'd like and that
they find building for multiple architectures (ARM64 and AMD64) difficult. This
led us to build the Docker Build Cloud product which hosts BuildKit builders for
both architectures in the cloud that can be used either from Docker Desktop or
with the Docker CLI anywhere that you use it (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.). It
was an interesting challenge because Build Cloud needed to be fast and secure.
To make it fast, we needed to get lots of compute very quickly. Meanwhile,
Security needed to consider that users can run their own untrusted code on our
platform and isolate it from other customers. We put a lot of effort into making
it as seamless as possible for users to adopt: It doesn't require big changes to
existing tools or pipelines, only a login and setup before the rest of the
process runs.

Docker Desktop's testing and deployment tools are quite unique. We support
multiple versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux which means that we have a large
test matrix. As Docker Desktop runs a VM, we need to test on bare metal or using
nested virtualization which makes this much more complicated. We also had to
write a lot of our own tools to handle rollouts of Docker Desktop to our users,
as there aren't tools available off the shelf to do this.

Docker Hub's scale makes it a continuing engineering challenge. We host over
[60PB of images](https://twitter.com/scottcjohnston/status/1753041815559631270)
and handle billions of requests per day. It is also a core part of lots of
developer and CI workflows which means that its uptime is really important.

#### How does on-call work?

We have a general tier 1 rotation that includes engineers across the company.
We're lucky to be distributed across Europe and the US, giving us wide working
hours coverage. If a major incident occurs, we involve the team that owns the
service. Newer services have the team that built them on tier 1 on-call.

<RichTitle tag="h3" icon={{ group: "generic", name: "checklist" }} id="key-features" text="Hiring process at Docker" />

#### How does the application process work? What are the stages and what is the timeline?

This applies to developers who apply to Docker. When we have a new opening, we
add it to https://docker.com/careers. Our recruiters also look for candidates
through channels like LinkedIn and GitHub.

A recruiter first screens the candidate to ensure that the role is a good fit
for them, that they are in the right location, etc. If they pass this screening,
the hiring manager speaks to them to determine if they are a cultural fit for
Docker and if the role is aligned with their interests. Passing this leads to
two technical interviews: one focused on coding and the other on architecture.
Finally, a senior engineering leader interviews the candidate to check fit.

You can find more information about the
application and hiring process [here](https://www.docker.com/careers/hiring-onboarding/).

#### What is the career progression framework? How are promotions and performance reviews managed?

We have two parallel tracks: Technical and Management. While we have two
official review/promo cycles per year, we are constantly having conversations
about career growth and goals and strive to promote employees as they meet their
goals. We use a career ladder for each track so both the employee and their
manager are aware of expectations and goals.
