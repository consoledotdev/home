        description: "Sourcegraph is building a code AI platform for developers
        and companies of all sizes, with the mission of making it so everyone
        can code. Coding is too complex for most people to get started, and
        it’s only getting worse as consumers demand more from software and
        code piles up. We’re making it less complex. The code AI platform
        includes 2 products: Code Search and Cody. Code Search makes it easy
        for developers to onboard to codebases quickly, make large scale
        refactors, and find and reuse code. Cody, our AI coding assistant,
        writes code and answers developers’ questions using their code graph
        as context, making it easy to learn about a codebase and start
        contributing."

              types. And it’s easier to search for error logs. As a result, the team

    How engineering works at Sourcegraph
</RichTitle>

#### How are the teams structured?

The Engineering department at Sourcegraph consists of: Development, Product
Management and Design. The org chart is [available on the Sourcegraph
website](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/team/org_chart/).

#### What tools do engineers use?

-   **Design:** Figma
-   **Source Control:** git & GitHub
-   **Issue tracking:** GitHub
-   **Docs:** Sourcegraph
-   **Devops:** Sentry, Honeycomb, Incident.io
-   **Comms:** Slack, Twitter, Blog

#### Can developers pick their own tools?

Yes, we generally believe everyone and every team should be able to choose the
tools that enable them to best do their jobs. We have many different editors in
use and a lot of the monitoring and deployment tools we use across the company
now were spearheaded by individuals. That being said, there are some soft
constraints around the introduction of tools and technologies that affect
others' work. For example, we are open to using new languages if there is a
reason to favor them over existing languages in our stack, but have a status quo
bias toward our existing set of languages.

#### How does the development process work? What's the process for working through bugs, features and tech debt?

Sourcegraph assigns work using a Job Fair system, treating all engineering work
as projects with business champions, tied to KPIs, and allowing the organization
to work as a single, flexible labor pool of freelancers, simultaneously
optimizing for business impact, velocity, and engineering career growth.

We generally use GitHub Issues and Projects as the roadmap source of truth. We
have a biweekly product demo day for features and fixes that are shipping.

#### How does code get reviewed, merged, and deployed?

-   Development happens in branches.
-   Changes then are squash-merged into our main branch following code review from
    code owners.
-   Deployment to sourcegraph.com is automatic after a change is merged into the
    main branch.
-   We have a monthly release cycle for self-hosted customers, which is cut from
    the main branch.

#### What is the QA process?

Automated CI using Buildkite, with automated end-to-end tests.

#### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges solved by internal teams as part of building the product?

-   [sg](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sg): internal tool for
    managing the Sourcegraph dev environment
-   Sub-repository permissions: enforcing code permissions within repositories.
-   Scaling up our infrastructure to support millions of open-source repositories
    and
    [private code on sourcegraph.com](https://about.sourcegraph.com/cloud-beta/).
-   Both [Notebooks](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/notebooks) and
    [Code Insights](https://about.sourcegraph.com/code-insights/) were created as
    hack projects to help with onboarding, documenting code investigations and
    understanding high-level trends in our code, but they worked so well, we ended
    up productizing it and releasing them to our customers.

#### How does on-call work?

-   OpsGenie for handling and routing alerts. Incident.io for collaboratively
    responding to incidents.
-   We have an on-call rotation, but no one gets woken up in the middle of the
    night, because we distribute the rotation to our teammates around the world
    (fully remote).

#### How does the application process work? What are the stages and what is the timeline?

Applications are received through our careers page and we have a standardized
engineering interview process plus a set of resources for candidates.

It is our goal to fill our openings as quickly as possible while maintaining a
high quality bar and a strong candidate experience. Once a candidate begins the
interview process with us, we aim to complete the interview process in 2-weeks
or less.

The process typically looks like this:

1. [Recruiter screen](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/talent/process/types_of_interviews/#recruiter-screen)
   (30m).
2. [Hiring Manager Screen](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/talent/process/types_of_interviews/#hiring-manager-screen)
   (30-60m).
3. Team interviews -
   [technical interview](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/talent/process/engineering_interview_process_candidates/#types-of-interviews)
   (60m) +
   [cross-functional team collaboration interview](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/talent/process/types_of_interviews/#cross-functional-team-collaboration-interview)
   (60m).
4. [Values interview](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/talent/process/types_of_interviews/#values-interview)
   (30m).
5. [Leadership interview](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/talent/process/types_of_interviews/#leadership-interview)
   (30m).

#### What is the career progression framework? How are promotions and performance reviews managed?

Our Career Frameworks help us define the responsibility level and expectations
of each role. Each level is defined by impact, seniority, knowledge, skills, and
job title, and is associated with a specific pay band. There are currently six
levels for software engineers at Sourcegraph. A level is composed of three
categories These categories are:

Proficiency: This is the demonstrated expertise in the skills relevant to the
role and level. Execution: This is knowing how and acting on what it takes to be
productive and achieve the right outcomes for Sourcegraph. Teamwork: This is how
you collaborate with others to make both them and yourself more effective.

More details on our Engineering Career Framework can be found
[here](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/engineering/dev/career-development/framework/).

Our promotion philosophy is to support the growth & advancement of Teammates, in
alignment with our values. Sourcegraph’s success is fueled by our incredible
Teammates, which is why we foster a culture of continuous growth and accelerate
opportunities to level up.

Promotion decisions are calibrated based on a Teammate’s achievements, execution
at a higher job scope, and values alignment. The People Partner and Leadership
Team are responsible for calibrating promotion nominations in alignment with our
Impact Review process and bi-annual promotion cadence.

Our Teammates can pursue promotion opportunities in two ways:

-   Through our promotion process to move up their specific Career Framework or
    Leadership track.
-   By applying and interviewing for open positions that are approved in our
    headcount plan. This type of promotion may occur outside of a review cycle, but
    eligibility is determined by prior Impact Assessment.

The following criteria support promotions:

-   A Teammate is already performing at the next level or job scope prior to
    promotion.
-   The business need exists for the role to increase in job scope, or capacity
    requirements show additional headcount at a higher job scope is required
    (IC5+ and M4+).
-   The promotion decision is occurring at a justified and fair rate.

More details on our talent assessment framework can be found
[here](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/people-talent/people-ops/process/teammate-sentiment/impact-reviews/).
