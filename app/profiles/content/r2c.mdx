#### How are the teams structured?

The teams right now are small enough that each of those teams has one engineer
manager, and then there's about five to nine people on each team. The teams are
structured based on their technical expertise. We have three main teams:

-   Our program analysis team is mostly OCaml wizards who are writing the core
    parsing and matching engine.
-   Our security research team consists of software engineers and security experts
    who are doing a mixture of things, but primarily writing rules and making sure
    that the tool is producing great results for our customers.
-   Our application team is a team of product-focused engineers and builds the web
    product in typed-python, flask, react and typescript.

And then we have one cross-functional team, which focuses on our second product,
[Semgrep Supply Chain](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-supply-chain), which
does third party code dependency scanning. That one is a mix where we've pulled
a couple people from each team.

#### What tools do engineers use?

-   **Design:** Figma
-   **Source Control:** GitHub
-   **Issue Tracking:** Linear
-   **Internal Documentation:** Notion
-   **Incident management:** PagerDuty and Datadog
-   **Monitoring:** Prometheus
-   **Communication:** Slack
-   **Build and Deployment:** GitHub Actions and Argo CD
-   **Component Design:** Storybook

#### Can developers pick their own tools?

We have a well documented path where we give everyone a Mac and gently nudge
people to use VS Code, but that's mostly just because it's easy to get help from
other people on the team. It’s not a requirement - many people are on Linux, and
some use Emacs or Vim or whatever they want.

If someone suggested a new tool that would affect the wider team, it'd be
considered on a team by team basis. We often enjoy the search for new tools and
if the team adopts it then it's accepted.

#### How does the development process work? What's the process for working through bugs, features and tech debt?

The engineering manager is responsible for what the team works on. We have a
loose agreement with our product team that we'd spend about 50% of time on new
features and 50% of our time on a combination of support and tech debt, which
seems to work pretty well.

We are a small startup, so we try to do what makes sense. One thing that we do
is twice a year we have a hackathon or a full hack week where everyone in the
company from sales to engineering is encouraged to spend that week to try out
new things and demo that to the company. We have pretty great prizes and then
usually at least two or three projects from that hack week then get pulled into
the main work.

We roughly follow an agile framework. We're trying to do one week sprints and
ship things. Once a month, we do a bug squashing day or bug squashing week, just
try to push those through. But it's not mandated, managers of the teams to
figure out what their team needs to do that month.

We do monthly goal setting and quarterly company strategy goals. We have metrics
and we use the term “singular goal” a lot for the north star metric. We try to
set SMART goals and try to hold ourselves accountable to make sure we are
actually creating an impact with our work.

#### How does code get reviewed, merged, and deployed?

To request a code review, engineers use the GitHub code review feature to tag
people who are relevant. We require all the tests to pass before it can either
be auto merged or unit merged in. As soon as it is merged, it will be deployed
to staging. And then approximately once a day, staging automatically gets
deployed to production; we have one click revert if we need to go back.

There's two ways to do rollbacks. One would be just undoing the change through
code. We try to have deterministic atomic builds. But database migrations don't
quite work that way - we try to write up and down migrations and then if need
be, we use Argo CD to deploy different versions. We can also simply point
production to old revisions, which are still available if needed.

#### What is the QA process?

We've prioritized end to end and integration testing. We have a few functional
tests for the core workflows that are essential, as well as other tests that
check if the website is down or if we can make comments on the core workflows in
the product.

We’re also just rolling out a new feature to allow customers to opt-in to beta
releases and get early access to new functionality.

#### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges solved by internal teams as part of building the product?

We use Treesitter, which is this technology that GitHub wrote to power their
Atom code editor, and now powers a lot of modern code editors. That's all open
source, so we were able to bring that in and use that as our parser. That
allowed us to add 17 languages to Semgrep very quickly.

In the context of writing rules, we've built a pretty interesting editor
workflow where people can take other people's rules and collaborate on it, tweak
it, make it better and share it back. So when the Log4J incident happened, we
had two actual external community members who were going back and forth together
working to find the best pattern to accurately detect Log4J with Semgrep.

Another interesting challenge that we faced was when we wanted to implement
impersonation. We use SpiceDB, which is an open source fine-grained permissions
database. We built a microservice that lets us do impersonation in a way that's
auditable and traceable so our customer success engineers can impersonate an
organization or a user when we need to reproduce issues.

#### How does on-call work?

We have three on-call rotations. For the open source part, there's an on call
that's mostly doing the release process. Every engineer, including the team
lead, is part of the on-call rotations - everyone gets a chance to carry a
little bit of that support, and the same thing is true for the rule writing
team, our security research team and our application team. When you are on call
here, you're really mostly just a traffic cop whose job is to fix easy things.
Otherwise, you're running an incident and you're trying to pull in engineers
from other teams to help you solve it, and get support from our SREs when
needed.

That's a pretty standard on-call process. For us, the philosophy of on-call is
always how do you give engineers freedom and responsibility? As we move down the
infrastructure, we have individual microservices where it is easy to identify
the service owner, then that way they get paged first if an incident occurs.

    Hiring process at r2c

#### How does the application process work? What are the stages and what is the timeline?

Candidates apply through our job website. Our team reviews the application
within two weeks and if we want to move forward, we'll reach out. The
application process consists of following steps:

-   **Initial call**, usually with a recruiter.
-   **Chat with the hiring manager**, who evaluates the technical skill of the
    candidate either by a live coding interview or a take home test.
-   **Virtual onsite interviews** which focus on software design, coding,
    debugging, or mentorship.
-   **Final interview** with one of the founders where candidates talk about our
    mission and values.

#### What is the career progression framework? How are promotions and performance reviews managed?

We do have a pretty extensive framework on the engineering side. Most engineers
would come in as an L3 and then get promoted to an L4, L5, L6, etc.

Performance reviews happen twice a year as that's mostly a check just to make
sure that we're understanding people's performance. We also do 30, 60, 90 day
check-ins for new hires.

We have a formal mentorship program, everybody gets a mentor. Our people team
has just started with a round robin arrangement but there's a pairing of people,
even across teams and functionally. For example, a couple of engineers are
paired up with a sales leader as one of their mentors to talk about professional
development and career growth. After this program ends, we'll have a mentee
program where more junior folks will help mentor more senior folks.
