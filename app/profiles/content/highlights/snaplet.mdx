### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges

One of the most interesting challenges that we recently tackled was when we
introduced the ability to subset a database, which is when you take a large
database and reduce it down by some sort of requirement. For example you might
say, “I want 1% of my users.” In order to do that, you have to understand the
relationships and the dependencies of the relationships in your database. You
have to sort them in a way that they don’t introduce broken relationships. This
was fairly complicated, but now that we understand it, it’s kind of fascinating.
You use topological sorts and it’s all doable. Everything that feels impossible
is doable if you just approach it from first principles and then work through
it.
