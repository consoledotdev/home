### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

The primary challenge weâ€™ve faced this year is converting our frontend from
rendering via a server-side templating engine in NodeJS, to React, and then
later adding NextJS in the middle for optimizations. The biggest challenge was
simply that we had a very large frontend app, with a sophisticated dashboard,
many marketing pages, and a lot of stakeholders that needed to ensure their
needs remained met during the transition.

Another challenge we faced was when we were getting attacked by some DDoS
adversaries. They were trying to DDoS our website by spiking the request count
to millions of requests per second. We had to work hard to build a strategy that
would fend off the attacks. We found some interesting ways to avoid these insane
request spikes by just making our system more scalable and react very fast to
these changes.
