### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

People are quite excited when they join Ably because they’re in a team of less
than 10 people, but they’re deploying to a truly global distributed system with
a five-nines uptime guarantee. The engineering department currently staffs 40
people - Ably has a small company startup vibe, but with engineering challenges
that you would normally find in big tech.

There is one pod that’s completely focused on just scaling us up, they give us
traffic projections orders of magnitude more than we can currently handle. The
tech lead for that team owns that problem, does some profiling, finds the
bottlenecks, looks at the architecture then finds the design level bottlenecks
and plans to evolve the system to handle orders of magnitude higher load. That’s
one of the engineering-led pods where there’s not so much need for product
management there, that’s just an optimization problem.
