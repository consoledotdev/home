### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We’re basically building our own auto-scaling, serverless runtime for tasks, for
Airplane scripts. That involved figuring out the model of the control plane and
data plane, and figuring out the APIs between things. Working on load testing
this was a fun project that had tangible metrics as we saw latencies decrease.

Closer to the front end side, we’re building authoring experiences for people in
the browser. This involves building an IDE in the browser. How do you apply
Airplane-specific semantics to build an IDE? Can you write something, see the
preview; can you live-test it in your browser; can you collaborate with others?
Building a better authoring experience is something that we’re pretty excited
about starting.
