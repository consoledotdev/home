### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

Being on-prem makes it difficult to reproduce a bug and is a little tricky for
us. And so, one of the things that we’ve solved, this is a mix of a development
and a production tooling, is something as simple as getting crash logs - when a
customer faces a problem, they get a pretty detailed trace back and log, which
they can then email to us. That has actually solved a lot of our problems and
we’re able to then try to reproduce stuff.

Most of our challenges are working in a heavily on-prem environment and figuring
out how to do that at a level that we think most of us expect from cloud
development where you have total visibility into everything that’s going on.
Being able to do that in a way that is secure and compliant, especially given
the nature of our product, is interesting.
