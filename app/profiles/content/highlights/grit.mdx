### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We’re constantly solving relatively interesting problems, mostly around program
analysis and machine learning. A fun project we’ve recently been tackling is how
to expand our tool to support additional languages by parsing and rewriting ASTs
from tree-sitter grammars. This involves understanding how to programmatically
transform the AST while preserving correct syntax and intent, while writing code
that interoperates between Scala and Rust.
