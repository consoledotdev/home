### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We are working on a new browser extension feature which will show the daily.dev
metadata in a sidebar alongside every page you visit - comments, bookmarks, even
a tl;dr of the article. The challenge there was to not impact the performance of
the page. We see ourselves as guests on the page, so we donâ€™t want to hijack and
impact the behavior. We had to reduce the number of requests whenever a page
loads and make sure everything stays out the way. This was a very interesting
challenge.
