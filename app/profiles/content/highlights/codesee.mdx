### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We built real-time collaborative editing of our diagrams (think Figma) by
developing a websocket-based server that uses CRDTs and a zero-downtime
deployment using our own leader election implementation. This is a strong
foundation that we will be improving and building on top of for some time.

We are visualizing code and code changes in ways that have never been done
before, and making those visualizations interactive. This requires innovation
and iteration from everyone from the designer to the frontend engineers.

We are parsing code in a (growing) number of different languages in order to do
code analysis, and existing tools rarely do precisely what we want. This creates
challenges around tweaking existing libraries (and contributing back) or
building new ones. Then testing and deploying those polyglot libraries as part
of our workers.
