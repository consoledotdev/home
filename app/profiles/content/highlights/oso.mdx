### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

Some examples of things we’ve worked on are:

-   We designed new built-in authorization primitives for our declarative policy
    language, Polar, taking inspiration from interfaces and traits in Rust, and
    function prototypes in C.
-   We built an interactive debugger and tracing to help users understand their
    policies and improve our internal development process.
-   We tracked down a memory leak in our Go library by looking at a user’s memory
    usage charts from Datadog.
