Steadybit aims to provide the best chaos engineering platform for SREs, DevOps
and developers to gain control of their cloud infrastructure. We highly
encourage experimentation. If you join the team, you'll have a chance to leave a
footprint in whatever area of interest you have. We are looking for folks who
like to be pioneers and who like to actively grab what they are an expert for
and start evolving it as the company grows.
