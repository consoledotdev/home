### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges

On the runtime side, one of the very interesting problems we faced was the
ability to snapshot a runtime state at the C++ level so that you can write it to
disk and then load it up later. It’s like a save button in your browser so you
can shut it down and then open your browser up exactly at that point in time,
then in that space we have the ability to do lightweight forking. The snapshot
persists to memory or disk and it’s hundreds of megabytes; you get a new content
process in under a second and it just keeps on running.

On the back end, the most interesting thing we’re doing is turning compute -
browser compute and NodeJS compute - into a state in S3 that we can query as a
database. You’re turning imperative execution into something functional and
queryable later, which you do to improve performance and reduce further
computation.

And then on the front end, we’re building dev tools: elements, console, network
monitor, debugger, and trying to do that in a functional way because we have a
time travel debugger. We started with something like Chrome dev tools and
Firefox dev tools, but runtimes are by nature imperative so a tool like Redux
made a lot of sense. Now that we have something more functional.
