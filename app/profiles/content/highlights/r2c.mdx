### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We use Treesitter, which is this technology that GitHub wrote to power their
Atom code editor, and now powers a lot of modern code editors. That’s all open
source, so we were able to bring that in and use that as our parser. That
allowed us to add 17 languages to Semgrep very quickly.

In the context of writing rules, we’ve built a pretty interesting editor
workflow where people can take other people’s rules and collaborate on it, tweak
it, make it better and share it back. So when the Log4J incident happened, we
had two actual external community members who were going back and forth together
working to find the best pattern to accurately detect Log4J with Semgrep.

Another interesting challenge that we faced was when we wanted to implement
impersonation. We use SpiceDB, which is an open source fine-grained permissions
database. We built a microservice that lets us do impersonation in a way that’s
auditable and traceable so our customer success engineers can impersonate an
organization or a user when we need to reproduce issues.
