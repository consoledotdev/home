### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We hold ourselves to a very high standard. This means that we can never go down,
have to be fast, have to be reliable, and have to scale with our customers’ ever
increasing scale and demands. Because of the nature of our business, every time
we onboard a large customer we have to deal with their whole scale, which can be
immense.

We are currently using a single cloud provider. Though in the long term, we want
to be in every data center in the world, to reduce latency and potential network
issues between ourselves and our customers. But for now, staying in AWS and
being multi region has worked well because, and when there’s a large enough
customer, we just deploy to the same region as them - if things go bad for them,
it goes bad for us as well, so it’s kind of in sync.

Within the region, we have multiple availability zones and a lot of redundancy
cross service. We use DynamoDB and Postgres, and we have fallbacks in place. If
DynamoDB is having issues, we can fall back to our backup database, for example.
