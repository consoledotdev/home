### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

On the infrastructure front, I think one of the interesting challenges that
we’re dealing with is that we’re processing a ton of data which needs to be used
for multiple use cases. We’re doing data aggregations to be able to give
statistics to users, but also trigger product events like alerts if a back
pressure is accumulating on your queues.

We’re also trying to give the customer the ability to search through that data
in a way that’s fairly efficient. Users need to slice and dice the data in
multiple different ways and see the events associated with it. So what you end
up with is serious data engineering challenges, where you have to move millions
of rows at a time in a way that’s efficient, that doesn’t create too much
replication lag, but also allows us to perform all the operations that we need
on it. This has led to discussions around which storage technology we should
use, what the schema should be, etc.
