#### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We have Mac runners that run tests all day long, deployed on
[MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/). They don't spin up and spin down,
which tends to accrue garbage if you have processes not shutting down cleanly.

Recently we upgraded to a new version of LLVM. On Rosetta, the x86 binaries were
taking 10 seconds to build instead of 3 seconds. Our tests all basically assume
that the system will connect up within three seconds, but that was timing out.
These timeouts meant the Trunk daemon kept respawning so we ended up with
thousands of them. This crashed the kernel of the OS and the system would
reboot. Tracking this down was complicated!
