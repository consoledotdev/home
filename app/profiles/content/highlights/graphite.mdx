### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

Displaying massive pull requests used to crush the front-end react rendering
performance. Interactivity, like dragging comment selections and unfurling
files, caused heavy lag. In response, we built custom virtualization (also
referred to as ‘windowing’) into pull request files. This way, Graphite only
renders lines of code visible in the viewport. The result is fewer total DOM
nodes and render performance that’s fast enough for smooth interactivity.
