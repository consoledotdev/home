### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

One exciting development project is moving from AWS RDS to CockroachDB, which is
a distributed SQL database. There’s a lot of excitement in the team working on
this. The technology itself is very interesting and challenging, and not a lot
of people in the team had experience with it, given that it’s fairly new. So
that’s currently something that is very exciting.

Another thing that some teams are working on, which requires a lot of
collaboration is moving to an event driven architecture. We’re not there right
now, but we’re slowly introducing Kafka - to start streaming data out of
services and then establish an event driven architecture.
