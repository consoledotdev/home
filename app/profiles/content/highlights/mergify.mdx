### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We rely heavily on the GitHub API for our application, which presents some
challenges in terms of following the APIâ€™s rules and avoiding being banned or
rate-limited. This requires us to carefully consider the number of API calls we
make and try to minimize them wherever possible.

Recently, we developed a new feature for more precise statistics, but it
resulted in a significant increase in API calls to GitHub. As a result, we had
to revert the change and come up with a new solution that would be more
efficient in terms of API usage. This is just one example of the challenges we
face when working with the GitHub API and trying to balance the needs of our
customers with the need to be mindful of API usage.
