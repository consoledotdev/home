### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We use Postgres JSON support quite a lot, we decided to use it rather than
introducing a separate document data store. As a result, there’s a lot of
interesting, complex JSON queries that run on Postgres. We have implemented a
new Postgres SQL variant designed for our dataset, that includes a SQL parser
and a conversion engine.

A lot of the configurations that we use have plugin points where customers can
write custom code in several different languages. This is an interesting
challenge because we need to support everything from a common expression
language to JavaScript.

There’s a lot of data manipulation that is not CRUD, we actually don’t do any
CRUD. We have PostgREST that sits in front of our database and we push most
things through that. There are a couple of SQL functions, and some graph related
work.
