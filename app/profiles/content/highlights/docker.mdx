### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We have heard from users that their builds are slower than they'd like and that
they find building for multiple architectures (ARM64 and AMD64) difficult. This
led us to build the Docker Build Cloud product which hosts BuildKit builders for
both architectures in the cloud that can be used either from Docker Desktop or
with the Docker CLI anywhere that you use it (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.). It
was an interesting challenge because Build Cloud needed to be fast and secure.
To make it fast, we needed to get lots of compute very quickly. Meanwhile,
Security needed to consider that users can run their own untrusted code on our
platform and isolate it from other customers. We put a lot of effort into making
it as seamless as possible for users to adopt: It doesn't require big changes to
existing tools or pipelines, only a login and setup before the rest of the
process runs.

Docker Desktop's testing and deployment tools are quite unique. We support
multiple versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux which means that we have a large
test matrix. As Docker Desktop runs a VM, we need to test on bare metal or using
nested virtualization which makes this much more complicated. We also had to
write a lot of our own tools to handle rollouts of Docker Desktop to our users,
as there aren't tools available off the shelf to do this.

Docker Hub's scale makes it a continuing engineering challenge. We host over
[60PB of images](https://twitter.com/scottcjohnston/status/1753041815559631270)
and handle billions of requests per day. It is also a core part of lots of
developer and CI workflows which means that its uptime is really important.
