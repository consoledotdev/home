### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

We are deploying the whole back-end to the edge, so, there’s a lot of unknowns
and a lot of things you have to fix and do on your own. For example, the AWS SDK
is not WebAssembly ready. It has been challenging to make that work with our
tech stack.

Most people think of the edge as lightweight, redirect feature flagging,
routing. But we’re actually deploying the whole back-end to the edge. We’re
dogfooding that approach. We are betting that for a lot of use cases, it makes a
lot of sense to be close to users - there’s no cold start, it’s serverless, and
it’s also regionless, so it’s fast for everyone. But it’s a fairly new piece of
technology, so things are not perfect. It’s like EC2 in 2006, that’s where we
are.
