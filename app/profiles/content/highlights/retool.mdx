### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges?

Building a real-time app development environment and it’s natural extensions,
for starters :) How do we support multiple concurrent users? How do we version
control Retool apps and help our customers deploy them across environments? How
do we support deep native integration to third party services (data warehouses,
datastores, custom APIs, etc)? The surface area that powers Retool today is so
vast, and we’re also innovating in adjacent areas!

The thing that’s most exciting about Retool is how much of a platform it is –
just permuting components + resources + code + Retool versions by our customer
leads to an unbounded set of possibilities. That’s fundamentally what allows our
customers to build anything with the product. By extension, supporting it across
all the permutations as we deploy at warp speed is a challenging
infra/correctness problem.

There’s a lot more here – from building a best-in-class layout and drag-n-drop
engine, running untrusted code safely, the tension between product
extensibility/power and performance, and making Retool even more accessible and
powerful.
