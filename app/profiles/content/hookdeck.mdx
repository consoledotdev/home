    How engineering works at Hookdeck
</RichTitle>

#### How are the teams structured?

We have two engineering teams - the product team and the infrastructure team.
The product team is multidisciplinary and it works in tandem with designers,
front-end engineers, and backend engineers. It does everything that you need to
actually be able to build out the whole surface of the product. This team works
on the dashboard, the APIs, the CLI.

The infrastructure team is focused on building the core infrastructure for the
product team to build upon. They work on things like queuing mechanisms, event
life cycle management, deployment, scalability, data engineering, security and
more.

#### What tools do engineers use?

-   **Data Storage:** Postgres, BigQuery, Elasticsearch
-   **Message Brokers:** Kafka, Pub/Sub, Redis
-   **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Workers, Kubernetes (GKE)
-   **Design:** Figma
-   **Source Control:** Git and GitHub
-   **Issue tracking:** GitHub projects
-   **Documentation:** Notion
-   **Incident management:** Better Uptime
-   **Communication:** Gmail, Slack, Loom
-   **Build and Deployment:** GitHub Actions, Docker
-   **Error Tracking:** Sentry and LogRocket
-   **Monitoring:** Google Cloud Monitoring, Better Uptime

#### Can developers pick their own tools?

Developers can pick whatever tool they want. We're using a monorepo structure
where we have a repo that you can launch via Docker Compose, but beyond that,
engineers can use whatever debugger, IDE, Git client, etc.

#### How does the development process work? What's the process for working through bugs, features and tech debt?

We start the development process by developing the theme and the road map for
the quarter, but it's not strictly set. These are the bigger goals that we're
trying to achieve. This gets divided into specific projects and those projects
are prioritized on a two week basis, but it's not a deadline - it's more like an
opportunity to realign and refocus on what we should be working on. Some
projects last more than one cycle, we're not working against the clock.

Once the project is in scope, we start working on it. It depends from week to
week, but generally we try to aim for about 50% of your work that's dedicated to
that project. Then the other 50% is focused on the issues pipeline. Whenever
there's bugs or refactoring opportunities, we put them inside our GitHub project
board and engineers pick bugs at their own discretion. We don't have a systemic
prioritization there, but we do keep one column that we call “to-do”, it's a
short list of things that seem more important.

There's a backlog, but anyone is free at any point to take something from it and
work on it. We do have a no bug policy where essentially any bug that we find is
automatically prioritized regardless of the impact or the size of that bug.

#### How does code get reviewed, merged, and deployed?

We're SOC 2 compliant and it's part of our policy to be reviewed by one
individual from the team affected by that PR. Once your PR is approved, then you
can merge it at your own discretion at any time into either staging or preview
environment branches.

When you merge something that requires specific QA, then you request a QA and
someone from the team will volunteer to QA. We do a rollout if there's no
pending QA on the branch, it happens mostly automatically, we just have to get
approval for the rollout from someone else from the team and then it goes out to
production automatically.

#### What is the QA process?

When someone requests a QA, they basically request it openly and then someone
from the team checks it. That is still on a very ad hoc basis. QA mostly tends
to be testing new things on the UX side because everything else is covered by
integration tests or end to end tests that are run automatically on each change.

#### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges solved by internal teams as part of building the product?

On the infrastructure front, I think one of the interesting challenges that
we're dealing with is that we're processing a ton of data which needs to be used
for multiple use cases. We’re doing data aggregations to be able to give
statistics to users, but also trigger product events like alerts if a back
pressure is accumulating on your queues.

We're also trying to give the customer the ability to search through that data
in a way that's fairly efficient. Users need to slice and dice the data in
multiple different ways and see the events associated with it. So what you end
up with is serious data engineering challenges, where you have to move millions
of rows at a time in a way that's efficient, that doesn't create too much
replication lag, but also allows us to perform all the operations that we need
on it. This has led to discussions around which storage technology we should
use, what the schema should be, etc.

And then there's a crossover in business and engineering concerns where we need
to do work in a way that's going to be cost efficient for the future. We have
extremely high up time requirements because people come to us for reliability.
They come to us because we're going to do it better than them in terms of the
uptime and reliability of receiving the webhooks. It is unreasonable for a
company our size to provide 100% uptime, so we have to make a few trade offs. In
our case, we have optimized for a very high up time, but at a potential cost of
increased latency. We guarantee that we’ll receive and ingest a webhook, but
have some leeway where it may not be processed immediately during an outage.

On the product front, the product team was tasked with designing and
implementing a better way of dealing with errors. Often when something goes
wrong, multiple errors have the same underlying cause, so we're working on
systems to be able to identify what those underlying causes are and then provide
a specific UX around giving you information related to that underlying cause.

#### How does on-call work?

We have on-call rotations and only the members of the core team are on call. We
have two approaches to how we structure salaries - one where you are on the
on-call rotation and one where you aren't. There's a calendar of 12 days, and
everybody does a three day rotation on those 12 days. There are two levels of
escalation - firstly, the engineer that's on call responds and if they are
unable to handle it by themselves then they can escalate it to our CTO.

We also have an incident response guide with a list of specific things to do in
case of an issue, a knowledge base of what are the different things that could
happen and how to respond to them.

<RichTitle tag="h3" icon={{ group: "generic", name: "checklist" }} id="key-features" text="Hiring process at Hookdeck" />

#### How does the application process work? What are the stages and what is the timeline?

The interview process goes through following stages:

1. Intro call to see whether our interests align with the candidate and share a
   little bit more about what Hookdeck is working on.
2. Follow up call for in-depth introduction, discussing the vision of the
   company and your role at Hookdeck.
3. Technical evaluation (90 mins): Candidate discusses some of their previous
   projects that they have worked upon and explains their thought process. If
   the candidates are unable to discuss their previous work due to NDAs, they
   have an option to take a technical test instead.
4. Team introduction: The candidate meets a few team members and co-founders.

#### What is the career progression framework? How are promotions and performance reviews managed?

Career progression is based on expertise. We implement a similar system to other
companies in terms of seniority where each grade is specifically defined. A lot
of the progression also comes from the growth of the company itself, so as the
company is growing, you're also taking on more responsibility. Eventually we're
going to be hiring other people that might, depending on what your intentions
are, involve more responsibility for you, or not depending if you want to take
those on.

We do monthly performance sync ups. Our company management structure is pretty
flat right now but we are going to have a manager with whom you talk about your
performance. We also do a yearly review where we also look at salary
adjustments.
