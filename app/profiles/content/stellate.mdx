#### How are the teams structured?

We’re still a small company so there's currently only one product team. We
expect to split teams out into design, engineering, and documentation in the
future but right now everyone is still working together as a cross-functional
team. A cross-functional team consists of a product manager, product designer,
junior manager, and then five to ten engineers.

Currently, we have five engineers full time which will be growing to 12 over the
coming few months. That will be the point when we start splitting.

#### What tools do engineers use?

-   **Project Management:** Linear, Notion
-   **Source Control:** GitHub
-   **Documentation:** ReadMe
-   **DevOps:** GitHub Actions
-   **Infrastructure:** Terraform, AWS
-   **Monitoring and Error-tracking:** Datadog
-   **Alerting:** Grafana, Checkly
-   **Incidents:** PagerDuty, incident.io
-   I**nternal Dashboards:** Retool

#### Can developers pick their own tools?

Yes, if it just affects you then you can go ahead and use whatever you like.
However, once it starts to affect the rest of the team that’s when we ask
everyone to agree first. For example we have a consensus on which languages we
write code in.

If it's a tool that just affects you, you can use what you want. That's not even
a question of, “do I have the budget for it or not?” You just buy it. We have a
company credit card, so if you want to have your own task tracker or a tool to
record videos, we don't care. Anything that is team related, we want the team to
agree on.

#### How does the development process work? What's the process for working through bugs, features and tech debt?

We have a biweekly sprint planning which we start with a backlog refinement
discussion where we make sure that the whole team owns all the issues and that
we clean things up together. We’re firm believers that the team should own that
together rather than it falling to a single person and nobody else knows what’s
happening.

We have a pre-planning session where different stakeholders provide their needs
for the next sprint. For example, customer success might need some changes,
marketing has some needs, and so on.

Product needs are given certain priorities in the meetings. After that,
engineers can raise technical debt issues and the fixes they want to do. In
pre-planning, everyone gets a good picture of what we want to do. We use
asynchronous Scrum Poker in Slack to run a blind voting system where people
don’t know what other people are voting so they are not biased towards a certain
topic.

In an optimal world, which does not always happen, everything is ready for the
sprint planning, so we can mostly talk about who wants to take which area and
work on which tickets. If a bug report is filed by a customer that our product
is broken, we usually mark it as urgent and then work through reports in
decreasing order of urgency.

#### How does code get reviewed, merged, and deployed?

We are on the path to SOC 2 compliance, and we have had mandatory code reviews
for a while now. Basically, the engineer who implemented it is responsible for
fully testing it, but gets support from the team to do so. For some features, we
have full featured preview URLs where we can see the changes before merging
them. For example, a blog post or a UI change in the dashboard.

#### What is the QA process?

The most effective trick is breaking down PRs in smaller pieces, so it's easier
to review for everyone involved. If it's a continuous stream of work, being able
to do a PR of a PR helps people to break things down. Apart from that, it always
depends on what is being implemented.

Design QA is also important. We recently launched a new dashboard. And so, our
designer went through the whole dashboard and created a list of things that
needed doing, consulting with the engineering team. In this case, we broke tasks
down into small pieces which were discussed on calls involving the designer each
step of the way. This helped to make sure that the end product is what the
designer actually imagined it to look like.

Of course we also use automation. We use Chromatic for visual regression
testing. We use Storybook for our UI components. We have basic integration tests
for the API. For our CDN, we have a lot of unit and end to end tests that
actually make sure that everything works as expected.

#### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges solved by internal teams as part of building the product?

We're currently rewriting some of our performance critical logic from TypeScript
to Rust. That is an interesting challenge, as you can't just copy the logic line
by line and need to change how you write code to make sure it's idiomatic Rust.

#### How does on-call work?

We use PagerDuty to manage our rotations, but are looking into incident.io as an
alternative approach to managing things. We have one engineer per week, but this
will change as we grow the team where we have eight engineers, with each team
covering half of the day. Until then, we work on a weekly basis and always have
a backup person assigned.

We also have basic runbooks in PagerDuty mostly created by old incidents.
Someone who does not know that part of the codebase should also be able to work
with that runbook just by reading it.

    Hiring process at Stellate{" "}
</RichTitle>

#### How does the application process work? What are the stages and what is the timeline?

The hiring process is fairly simple and can be completed in one day, but usually is spread over a week, it depends on the candidate’s availability. The process works as follows:

-   Initial screening call with an internal recruiter (30 mins)
-   Screening call with hiring manager for that specific role (30 mins)
-   Our values and employee handbook is public, anyone can look it up. We conduct a interview focused on those values (60 mins)
-   Technical assessment
    -   Live coding assessment on a video call (60 mins): Candidates build a new product
    -   Technical discussion (60 mins): Discussion about code created in the last round and what to expect after joining our team.

#### What is the career progression framework? How are promotions and performance reviews managed?

This is typically something that larger companies would implement, but we are
currently in the process of establishing our framework because it’s something we
care about. We have a one job, one pay compensation philosophy - meaning you
will get the same salary for the same job whether you are in India, or in San
Francisco. We are currently in the intermediate state, it's not perfect yet and
we are in the process of rolling out levels company-wide that are actually
department agnostic.

This will be mostly about how people work - we will have an individual
contributor track and a manager track in there. We are trying to implement a
similar philosophy as many FAANG companies these days, you don't need to become
a manager in order to progress. We don't want to push anyone to be a manager if
that’s not what they want to do. All of that is being formalized right now.
