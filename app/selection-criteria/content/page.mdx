### Interesting tools

Each week we feature and review 2-3 interesting developer tools in the Console
[newsletter](/latest/) and [on our website](/tools/).

Our selection criteria are explained below. The more of these questions we can
answer positively, the more likely a tool is to be featured. We try to be
objective but there is always a subjective element to deciding what we think is
the best, most interesting set of tools each week:

-   Is this interesting and useful to developers?
-   Is the primary user a developer? A developer might use it, but is it built
    specifically with developers in mind?
-   Is there a self-service signup? A demo or speaking to sales may be an option,
    but an individual developer should be able to try it themselves without
    speaking to anyone.
-   Would this form part of a regular-use set of developer tools? Does it fit into
    the development cycle? Is it a part of the development flow?
-   Does it make me a better developer? Does it help me reduce/manage bugs,
    improve build times, get code to production faster, reduce/manage errors, etc?
-   Would this be used by advanced power-users? Does it support dark mode, is
    there an API and/or CLI, are there keyboard shortcuts, what about
    accessibility?
-   Is the tool high quality? Does it work on multiple platforms and/or browsers?
    Is it easy to install/deploy? Does it do the job it claims?
-   Is it being actively maintained with regular bug fixes and updates?
-   Does it have good documentation? Is it fast?
-   Does it have any negative impact on security or privacy?
-   How would I feel recommending this to my friends? Would I tweet a link to it?

### Betas

We only [list](/betas/) early access, alpha, or beta releases of tools where
developers are the primary user.

To determine whether something falls under this definition, we
use [Semver](https://semver.org/) version numbers i.e. the release must be pre
1.0 and/or have an appropriate label in the version number e.g. `1.0.0-beta`.
Alternatively, the word "beta", "preview" or similar should appear somewhere
easily discoverable on the website, release notes, and/or documentation. Any GA
or stable releases are not eligible.

### Sponsors

[Console works with vendors](/advertise/) who want to reach our audience of
experienced developers. These are run as a sponsored text ad clearly marked in
the newsletter. We do not do sponsored reviews.
