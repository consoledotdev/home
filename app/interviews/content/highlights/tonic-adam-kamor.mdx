### What is Tonic? Why did you build it?

We built Tonic because it is a problem we have all faced in our former
professional lives. It was a problem that my co-founders and I thought we were
particularly well suited to solve, given our backgrounds all coming from data
companies.Â I worked previously at [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), which is
a data visualization company, as did my co-founder Ian Coe. Customers would
sometimes email saying, this workbook isn't working, what's going on? You'd ask
for data as we need data to reproduce the issue, but oftentimes they couldn't
send the data, because it was sensitive.
