### What is Retool and why did you build it?

Retool is the fastest way to build internal apps and tools. We all used to work
on internal tools ourselves, and we realized that we were building tools that
were quite similar. That’s how the idea for Retool came about.

Internal tools are not particularly desirable to write for most software
engineers, in the sense that they don't really progress the art form of the
business model. At least from my personal experience, they are a bit of a tax
when you're building product: you build the internal tool in order to support
that product in the wild.

This creates a good opportunity for us to effectively group the common pieces,
and ship them as an abstraction. This is what Retool does— it allows people to
build internal tools easily, in a highly accelerated way.

Every internal app has some sort of view and a connection to a datastore. Retool
is a collection of drag and drop components that allow you to construct that
front-end, and hook into your back-end. We also make all of that really simple.
You can get what might take the order of weeks in just hours, and be set up with
a tool and process that works out of the box. It's also beautiful, elegant, and
a lot easier than writing everything from ground up.
