### What is Swimm? Why did you build it?

First, we help you discover documents with our IDE plugins. While you write or
read code, you will see the Swimm icon, which tells you that you have a rich
text document about this piece of code.

Second, we help you sync those documents and keep them up to date. If you
integrate Swimm into your CI, we check every PR and see if you’ve broken any
documentation. If your change was meaningful, we will stop and say, "Hey,
there's documentation about this part. Maybe you should review it." If it's not
meaningful, like changing file names, moving code around, and even replacing
whole chunks of code (we have a patented algorithm to detect that), we can
Auto-sync it for you and say, "We’ve got you covered, your documents are up to
date.”
