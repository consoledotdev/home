### What is Tonic? Why did you build it?

[Tonic.ai](https://www.tonic.ai/) is the fake data company. We provide fake data
so that developers and QA can test their application code against safe,
de-identified versions of their application database.

Why would you use fake or synthetic data instead of real data? Particularly in
regulated industries, access to data is very difficult. It may be impossible to
test against production data. Even outside of regulated industries, you don't
necessarily want to be working with customer data as a developer. The more
distance you can get from real sensitive data as a developer or data scientist,
the safer everyone is.

Recently, we've been building a product,
[Djinn](https://djinn.tonic.ai/?signup), which is focused on the data-science
workflow and those use cases. Instead of building an entire de-identified
production, de-identified application database, the data-science workflow
typically starts with a dataset, which is some view or table within this
application database.

The tool takes these views and builds generative models that are capable of
producing synthetic data, which has the same statistical properties as the real
data. Synthetic data can be used in place of real data to train machine-learning
models, build dashboards, to do exploratory data analysis.

This lets the data scientists get started on their job a lot faster than they
could if they were waiting around for access to real data. This is something
that we're quite excited about. In addition to the privacy use case,
increasingly we're seeing people that want to use synthetic data for the data
augmentation use case.
