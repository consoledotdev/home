### What is Dodgeball? Why did you build it?

Dodgeball is a single integration for managing fraud and malicious user behavior
on any application. Dodgeball protects applications by tracking visitors (this
is optional) and by executing checkpoints at key moments of risk, such as
account opening, login, and payments.

It doesn't stop at just those use cases â€“ you can use a checkpoint to secure
anything, so anytime you're developing a new feature for any sort of product,
particularly two-sided marketplaces, you can put in a checkpoint to address risk
that might evolve over time. A classic use-case is when a fraudster comes in and
starts posting stuff on your platform, which decreases trust and safety in your
platform, and you need a way to secure that for a two-sided marketplace, and put
in a checkpoint. You can start adding in things like IDV, do MFA for helping to
prevent account takeovers, without needing to make a single line of code change.

Our mission is to make it a no-brainer for every company to protect their
applications from fraud. You can integrate it into your application in 5
minutes, it's free for startups, and well-documented. We believe if we can make
it easy for companies to increase trust and safety on their platforms, by
extension we can make the world a safer and more trusting place.
