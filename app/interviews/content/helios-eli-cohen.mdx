### What is Helios? Why did you build it?

[Helios](https://gethelios.dev/) is a developer platform that helps you increase
your development velocity when building cloud native applications. It started
from my personal pain.

Before starting Helios, I was working for a fintech company and we were building
a marketplace for all the big banks of the world. Billions of dollars were
running through our system on a daily basis. The more services we deployed, the
slower our dev velocity became—it was very frustrating. Eventually, I took some
of the best engineers in my group and let them build the infrastructure that
would allow us to increase our dev velocity, quality and productivity. And then
I realized, "Okay. This is something that we need to do for everyone." So I left
to start building Helios, and these are exactly the challenges we focus on
today.

Today, everyone is moving to the cloud. With this transition, organizations are
breaking their monoliths into microservices or they're starting their
architecture with microservices and serverless. We see developers struggle
within those architectures, so our goal is to help them increase their dev
velocity. With Helios, the dev team can easily and quickly see a full view of
all of their API inventory, reproduce failures, and automatically generate
tests, from their local environment all the way to production. So essentially,
we're accelerating the R&D work by streamlining activities from troubleshooting
and testing to design and collaboration.

We try to go beyond observability. We are taking observability and shifting it
left towards the developer. Most of the traditional observability tools are
focused on production monitoring, they're focused on DevOps and SRE. We are
focused on developers, on helping them own their services successfully even in
full production. We are making distributed tracing data accessible and
actionable. We're helping teams leverage those traces, get insights from them,
reproduce issues, and generate tests. We shorten the time it takes to
troubleshoot applications from hours to minutes, and to test systems from days
to less than a day.

### What does a "day in the life" look like?

I'm the co-founder and CEO of Helios. So for me, my day mainly involves external
meetings, speaking with prospects, speaking with customers, interviewing new
potential candidates, syncing with our leaders about product, marketing, sales -
it's really a mixture. That's really what I like about the job, that there is no
typical day. Every day is different and I get to solve new problems and meet new
people.

### What is the team structure around Helios?

So besides me, we also have Ran - he is co-founder and CTO. We have actually
known each other for almost 20 years - like many other Israeli entrepreneurs, we
served together in the Israeli Defense Forces and after that, we studied
together in university and then worked together in the software industry. When
he came back from Silicon Valley last year, we decided to start Helios together.
Other than that, we have Maya, who leads our product - she used to work with Ran
previously and she's a great product leader.

We also have Aviv, who is our dev advocate. So he's in charge of all the
interactions with potential customers, with doing all of our dev advocacy,
community and stuff like that. And we have around seven developers from the best
companies in Israel, people we know from our mutual past. A big part of the
reason for our success thus far is because of the great team we assembled. It
really feels like an elite team!

### How did you first get into software development?

I studied computers in high school, and have loved them since. And then during
my army days, I was exposed to the bigger picture of technology. After the army,
I decided to study computer science and that's when I started doing it
professionally. I've been doing that for almost 15 years now, and I'm still
super excited about it.

I actually started with Pascal back in the early days and after that Java,
Python, and JavaScript. I think Python is still the easiest for me. But now I've
started looking into Go. We have some projects in Go, which is super exciting,
but I have less time to code these days.

I've been in engineering positions, product positions, and really like to be
hands-on. Obviously, today it's not possible, but I always love to read about
new tools. That's also why I'm really a big fan of what you do at Console.

### What is the most interesting development challenge you've faced working on Helios?

We're handling many different things from the level of instrumenting code to
building a very slick UI. The challenge is actually making this big machine work
together. Every day, we get to handle very low level things, such as at the
instrumentation level in Java, and then we have all the data in Elastic. It's
also big data challenges, scaling challenges, and making everything work really
smoothly in React. We invest a lot of time in tying everything together in a
very complex architecture, especially today when we have many customers scaling
it and making it reliable for themselves.

### What is the most interesting tech you are playing around with at the moment?

One of our challenges right now is doing auto-instrumentation on top of
OpenTelemetry with Go, which is something very unique. There aren't any other
solutions like that on the market. We believe it will be a game changer for our
customers. This is something that is very challenging because due to the nature
of the language, doing auto-instrumentation with Go can be quite difficult. So
working with OpenTelemetry is very interesting right now.

### Describe your computer hardware setup

I use a MacBook Pro, 13-inch, the M1 from 2020 and I really like the wireless
Apple keyboard. I'm a big fan of the Logitech MX 3—kind of old-fashioned. I'm
addicted to AirPods and I have a Dell monitor (24 inch).

### Describe your computer software setup

**OS:** macOS.

**Browser:** Chrome.

**Email:** Gmail.

**Chat:** Slack.

**IDE:** IntelliJ and Sublime

**Source control:** GitHub and Git.

### Describe your desk setup

I have a standing desk here now, you can make it go up or down with the push of
a button.

### When coding

**Daytime or nighttime?** Night.

**Tea or coffee?** Tea.

**Silence or music?** White noise.

### What non-tech activities do you like to do?

Hiking. I like hiking with my family. Just before COVID started, I went on a
caravan trip in New Zealand with my wife and my daughter, which was great.
