### What is Metrist and why did you build it?

Our mission at [Metrist](https://metrist.io/) is to give software developers and
IT leaders the same level of visibility into the third party cloud products that
they build on as they have with the software that they build themselves. Apps
are built on top of other apps. That starts with anything from a dozen different
services at AWS to APIs like Twilio, Stripe, Easy Post and cloud tools like
CircleCI and GitHub. If one of those tools goes down, you risk going down or at
least having a degraded user experience or an inability to ship code.

The problem that we identified is twofold - one is it's really hard to either
find out about or verify that it's a third party that's causing the problem, not
you and your code, and the things you control. The second thing is it's really
hard to hold your vendors accountable to what their SLAs are. Metrist empowers
people to monitor the services that they rely on. We put the health of all of
your third party cloud dependencies into a single dashboard, alerting you about
outages typically 10 to 20 minutes before a status page gets updated. We provide
you enough details to not only answer the question is it me or is it them? But
also answer, what is the problem, will it impact me, and is there anything I can
do about it?

One of the reasons I was excited to start this was because while working at
PagerDuty, talking to people about incident response and observability, I just
kept hearing over and over again from people that their downtime is tied back to
a third party, not their own software. But I didn't see monitoring tools
changing or adapting to focus more on those things. The New Relic and Datadog
agents can tell you that there's a problem with a call to a third party, but
there was this sense of uncertainty over is it me or is it them?

Current synthetic tools such as Datadog, Grafana, New Relic hit a URL, if it
returns a certain status code, they do a thing and maybe run some logic if it
calls another thing. We go a step further where we actually stitch together an
end to end workflow of what to expect. If you are creating a bucket in S3, we
verify that the bucket exists, we then start uploading files to that bucket,
deleting things, then removing the bucket itself. If an endpoint is supposed to
send you an email or send you a webhook, we wait for those things and report
back how long it took to receive.

And then the bigger problem was holding them accountable. How do I know if they
hit their SLA last month or last quarter? We aim to solve that visibility
problem that is becoming a bigger piece of the developer's operational workload.

### What does a "day in the life" look like for you?

One thing I don't do anymore is code. In the early days, I put together a
prototype, but I don't really code anymore. Now it depends on what's going on.
So in the early days, it was helping with fundraising. Then it was hiring a
team. As a CTO, I manage both the engineering and product. Day to day, that's
literally going into the Jira board, making sure all the lanes are full, helping
in the stand-up, identifying blockers and just managing the engineering team.
It’s really about managing people, making sure everyone has enough to work on,
making sure the engineers are happy.

### What is the team structure around Metrist?

We are a 100% remote distributed team. I'm in San Francisco, Jeff is in Portland
and most of our engineers are in Canada. We also hire University of Waterloo
co-op students every term. They're with us for four months and work full time on
the same sort of tickets as everyone else. Currently, we're five engineers, two
co-op engineers and then we have a business development rep and a content
manager.

### How did you first get into software development?

I started when I was in high school. The local internet service provider that I
was using, they were both a free net and a dial up internet service provider. If
you met certain criteria they offered free internet access or you could pay for
dial up. So I joined them as a volunteer to help, it was called their mentorship
program. I would help people in the community learn how to use email and
newsgroups and browse the information superhighway, these sorts of things.

And when I was there, an older student right clicked on a page and opened source
code, and said, did you know this is how webpages are built? And I was blown
away, my mind started racing. Then I got into HTML, not coding, but generating
stuff dynamically and that sort of thing. I built some systems to report to
users how much dial up time they were using, a little search engine, that sort
of thing.

I went to school, did computer science, and then spent the first 10 years of my
career not building anything terribly interesting. It was actually starting at
Server Density where I worked for my first real software startup, which was
awesome. And that really helped when I got to PagerDuty and beyond.

My favorite language is C# - it's the one I've used the most in 15 years of my
career. If I need to just code and get something done, I always use that, but I
do really like Elixir as well. I've also dealt with Perl, PHP, Classic ASP,
Python, Ruby, Scala. I hated Scala, it's terrible.

### What is your tech stack?

For our back end we're using Elixir and Phoenix Live View for the web UI. We
also have monitors, the things that do the end-to-end tests - those can be
written in any programming language, but the ones we have are a mix of C#,
Python, Node, and Java.

### What is the most interesting development challenge you've faced working on Metrist?

After the prototype phase was over and we had to get serious about things, we
decided to use event sourcing and CQRS for our entire platform. That means every
human interaction, any machine interaction with our software runs commands that
emit events. We have this long event log from the beginning of time until now of
everything that's happened in our system.

The alternative to this was the classic CRUD application where you're creating,
reading, updating, deleting records. We don't do that - we have an event stream
and then based on what we want to see, we create projections on that event data.
It's an architecture that’s been around for a while, but it was a paradigm shift
for us to adopt. It was like, oh wait, if I want that thing to show up over
here, I have to run a command, which will generate an event and then the
projection will pick it up. That can be a challenge for new hires, but it really
fits the problem we’re trying to solve.

### What is the most interesting tool you are playing around with at the moment?

I would just want to give a shout out to the
[Commanded](https://hexdocs.pm/commanded/Commanded.html) library. It is an open
source event sourcing module that we use. It essentially runs our whole business
and we've contributed back to it.

Personally I try to not do tech stuff in my spare time!

### Describe your computer hardware setup

I'm a PC enthusiast, I always try to build what I use. Currently I am using a
10th gen Intel overclocked at 4.7 gigahertz with 32 gigs of RAM and a RTX 3080
for gaming. That's my primary driver. I've also got a BenQ 240 Hertz gaming
monitor, which I think only does 1080p but it's good enough for games and
coding. I've got another HP monitor on the side here and an MSI gaming laptop
that I use when I travel. I would like to get a mechanical keyboard, but I can’t
decide which one to get. I use all the gaming stuff, not a Mac in sight.

### Describe your computer software setup

-   **OS:** Windows.
-   **Browser:** Brave.
-   **Email:** Gmail Web UI.
-   **Chat:** Slack and Discourse.
-   **IDE:** VS Code.
-   **Source control:** Git and GitHub.

### Describe your desk setup

I have a gaming chair. There's built-in shelves in my condo and unfortunately
what that means is it's not a standing desk. I used to have one.

### When coding

**Daytime or nighttime?** Night.

**Tea or coffee?** Coffee.

**Silence or music?** Music without lyrics, like [Nick
Johnston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0EBmPvDeGA) and [I Built the
Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTBdO18zmxQ).

### What non-tech activities do you like to do?

Although I haven't done it in the last couple of years, I enjoy running in
triathlons. I did that a lot from about 2015 to 2019. I enjoy gaming and
reading. I read and practice drumming a lot.
