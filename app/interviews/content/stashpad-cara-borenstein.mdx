### What is Stashpad and why did you build it?

[Stashpad](https://www.stashpad.com/) is a notepad. I’m a software engineer, and
I set out to create tools to help other developers like me to work better and
enjoy their work. I started with some ideas, little things I thought could be
better, but when I really dug into it and started to sit next to other
developers as they were working, what I saw is that there are a couple of apps
that developers pretty much always have up on their screen. They have their code
editor, a browser, Slack, and then there's a notepad. All of the other tools
except the notepad have gotten a ton of investment, but the notepad is often
just a plain text file – it's super bare bones. When I saw that, I realized,
"Oh, that's actually how I manage all my work and process my thoughts related to
work. It's so important and it hasn't been thought about in this way." And so,
we set out to reimagine the notepad for developers like us.

Stashpad is better than just a text editor in two ways. The first is that it has
all the features that developers would expect of any tool. It has markdown
support, dark theme or light theme. You can customize any of the key bindings,
and it's very keyboard centric. It has code block support with lots of different
languages, code syntax highlighting, all those things that you expect as a
developer.

And then, to me, where it gets even more interesting is that, as a professional
software developer you often have to jump around different tasks. There’s
deep-focus work, but also a lot of context switching. That's just a necessary
evil. Stashpad is specifically designed to let you jump across those different
threads and jot things down, compartmentalized, such that you never get too
disorganized and always feel pretty good about where you're at.

### We want to help developers do their daily job

We’ve been thinking about how AI might help as well, but we always keep in mind
how Stashpad is going to change the way that developers code and work on
projects. I'm very skeptical of just wrapping ChatGPT around it to make the
product sound cool. I'm really trying to think about what the use cases are
where it actually is adding concrete value. Better yet, what are the use cases
where people are already using ChatGPT on top of Stashpad or adjacent to it.

The main one that I've actually seen a small number of people do alongside
Stashpad, is they'll write their raw quick notes in Stashpad and then, if they
want to put an update in Jira, or wherever their team does status updates,
they'll take that and run that through a ChatGPT to make it more formal. So,
that's one possible thing, but I'm skeptical about building things until I feel
like it's actually going to add real value.

### What does a "day in the life" look like for you?

Recently, I haven't been coding all that much, except for little opportunities
to automate things and jump in on small tickets. But, a lot of how I think about
it is, as a founder, I'm always thinking about what's our biggest gap right now?
What is just holding us back the most, and then trying to look for solutions to
that.

Identifying those gaps and solutions means talking to our customers all the
time, watching them work, watching what other tools are you using Stashpad
alongside? Things like that.

### What is the team structure around Stashpad?

It's me and my co-founder. We're both software engineers by background. He still
is coding a bunch. And then, we also have three full-time developers and a
designer. We're based in Durham, North Carolina.

### How did you first get into software development?

I was lucky in that when I was in ninth grade, my high school had a computer
science department, and a very passionate computer science teacher. He took all
the ninth grade girls who were in advanced math and auto enrolled them in his
computer science intro class, and told us that he wouldn’t let us drop it for at
least a month. He just made it really fun and was like, "You have to stick with
it for a month." A bunch of us ended up studying computer science throughout
high school and college, and having careers in computer science, now.

My first language was Java, that's what I learned in high school, and then, in
college it was also a lot of Java, some C, which was challenging, but also fun.
And then, a little bit of functional programming in college with OCaml. Then
Scala and Python. Now at Stashpad, I work with a lot of TypeScript, JavaScript
and we use React and React Native for the mobile apps.

### What is the most interesting development challenge you've faced working on Stashpad?

One of the features that developers enjoy is that you can use Stashpad
completely local to one device, and then set up your own sync, or you can sync
to the cloud and use it on mobile. To get that feature supported, we use MongoDB
Realm. They have really, really fast sync, which is awesome. But, their software
is really designed so that the applications built on it are either synced or
local. It does not have the ability to toggle between the two. Setting up the
logic where you can either use Stashpad local or synced, and change your sync
status whenever you’d like to, that had a lot of logic, a lot of test cases to
cover. It was a little tricky but that has been pretty satisfying to be able to
use.

### What is the most interesting tech you are playing around with at the moment?

The most obvious one, and I feel like you can't not say it, is ChatGPT. To me,
it's so much fun - it takes you back to early days of hacker culture, of just
what can you make this thing do, and what does that mean for where things can
go? It's just really fun to play around with it.

Just for fun, I was working on a function for importing notes into Stashpad, and
I was like, "How could I make ChatGPT do an import function for me?" And so, as
you play with it, you're like, "Wow." instead of going to Stack Overflow and
then going back and forth like that, it's writing the code for you. You just
have to define the requirements and then the error messages and stuff. So,
really fun. Really fun to play around with.

### Describe your computer hardware setup

I just have a standard MacBook Pro 13. I'd like to get a new computer at some
point. I use it with a Dell 27” 4K monitor, and Apple Magic Keyboard. The thing
that I like the most is that I have a Logitech MX Vertical Mouse – you hold it
vertically and it is nice to work with.

### Describe your computer software setup

**OS:** macOS.

**Browser:** Chrome.

**Email:** Superhuman.

**Chat:** Slack.

**IDE:** WebStorm.

**Source control:** GitHub.

### Describe your desk setup

I have the Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk, you can go up and down. Honestly, I'm
usually down!

### When coding

**Daytime or nighttime?** Night.

**Tea or coffee?** Coffee.

**Silence or music?** Silence.

### What non-tech activities do you like to do?

I love to be outdoors, hiking or playing tennis. I also really love, and find it
inspiring to go visit different artsy places. I recently got to go to the
Wynwood neighborhood in Miami. They have these incredible murals everywhere.
Everything you look at, someone has carefully painted it with this really
creative idea. I just find that so inspiring
