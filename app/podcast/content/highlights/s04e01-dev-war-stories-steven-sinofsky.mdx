**Steven Sinofsky:** Bill was super interesting. He was, in a sense, this very
interesting combination of business strategy, product strategy, and technology
strategy. And whenever he would really push it, he was most comfortable trying
to be a technology strategist. And to him, that was all about architecture. And
so architecture, if you read a book like Fred Brooks, _Mythical Man-Month_,
architecture is everything. Architecture in software is like this Nirvana.

**Steven Sinofsky:** And the beauty of how Apple managed their operating system
was they just didn't add a lot of features. But we had a team five times as big,
adding features every release, and it was just not getting— My measure of
success is not “Did we get the release done?” but “Was it making people do new
things with the product?” And Windows had long stopped doing that. The ecosystem
of software and hardware had probably died around 2000. And so when it came time
to do Windows 8 — and obviously _Hardcore Software_ has the whole timeline and
all this stuff — but the thing we really wanted to do was take the product and
build on it and all the things that were great about it, but bring it into a new
era of computing from top to bottom or what we said was “from the chipset to the
experience".
