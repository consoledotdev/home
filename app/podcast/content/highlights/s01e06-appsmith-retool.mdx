**David:** One of the nice things about Retool is it allows you to query all the
sources with SQL, even if they aren't databases. Appsmith and Retool both expose
the UI so that everything is a JavaScript object. If you need more
customizability, then you can just get into the code and you can even create
your own react components with Retool. The main difference then is the
philosophy behind how these are developed, so I thought it'd be interesting to
have a discussion about that.
