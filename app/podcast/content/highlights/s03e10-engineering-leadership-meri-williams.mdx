**Meri Williams:** I think that there's a tendency, particularly when you first
become a manager, if you are the flavor of technical leader that is a manager,
actually, even if you're a very senior individual contributor, hiding in the
code is a problem that I see quite often, it can be very comfortable. It's where
people feel that most at home, the feedback loop is so addictively short, you
write some code, you find out if it passes the tests almost instantly, if you're
in a good dev setup. And I think that people can hide in what's comfortable. And
really the more senior you get, the more likely it is that your real problems
are people problems or your real problems are influencing or getting people to
align to a strategy. And so I think hiding in the code is one real problem or
mistake that I see people make.

**Meri Williams:** I think that there are a lot of companies where their problem
is at the top of the funnel, if you will, they're just not attracting people to
be interested. And that tends to be best addressed by employer branding work.
Being known as a place where good work is going to happen and people are going
to develop well. And it's actually something where I think startups often have a
real advantage over established businesses because they can be really clear on
what the purpose of the organization is. They can give a lot more autonomy.
