**Zach:** When you run a terminal today on your modern Mac, you're actually
running a terminal emulator like you said, and that's a piece of software that
is copying the behavior of that hardware. And so the terminal emulator, when you
run terminal.app or Warp or iTerm, it's an actual sort of native GUI app that
runs on your Mac. It's pretending to be this piece of hardware. And it's
pretending to do that at a pretty deep level.
