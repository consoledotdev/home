        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/data-minimisation/">
        track as little as possible</a>, only collecting what will help us
        improve <a href="https://console.dev">Console</a>. To do that, we want
        to understand the following metrics:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How many visitors have been on our website.</li>
            <li>Where those visitors are referred from.</li>
            <li>Which pages they visit.</li>
            <li>What browser are they using, and whether it is mobile or
                desktop.</li>
            <li>How is that trending over time.</li>
            <li>How many email subsribers we have.</li>
            <li>Whether the tools we include in our weekly newsletter are
                interesting.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using these simple metrics, we can analyse how many people sign up
        to our newsletter, which pages are the most popular (so we can invest
        more in those types of page), whether our marketing is working (paid
        vs organic), and how we&apos;re doing over time. Knowing browser and
        device type helps us ensure we test on the right platforms.</p>

        <p>We don&apos;t need anything more detailed, and certainly don&apos;t
        need or want to track website visitors on an individual level. We
        especially want to avoid services which conduct mass tracking across
        the internet e.g. Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.</p>

        <p>If you sign up to our newsletter then we collect your email, and
        may link a referrer reference to help us track our marketing efforts.
        We don&apos;t track whether our emails our opened, but are interested in
        which links get clicked so we can improve our selection criteria.</p>

        <p>Our newsletter and website contains links to websites and
        third-parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please
        note that these websites have their own privacy policies. Please check
        these policies before you submit any personal data to these
        websites.</p>

        <p>On that basis, this is our Privacy Policy:</p>
