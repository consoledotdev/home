Our goal is to track as little as possible, only collecting what is essential
for running Console.

On our websites, this means we collect metrics about the number of visitors,
where they have come from, which pages they visit on our website, and whether
they sign up to our products. Knowing browser and device type helps us ensure we
test on the right platforms. 

If you click through one of our ads, such as on Reddit or Twitter, we track
whether you then sign up using their tracking. We don’t need or want to track
website visitors on an individual level and we especially want to avoid mass
tracking across the internet e.g. Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.

To enable this, we use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), a [privacy-first
analytics product](https://blog.console.dev/picking-privacy-first-analytics/)
that [does not set any cookies](https://plausible.io/data-policy) and only uses
anonymous metrics.

If you sign up to our newsletter then we collect your email and may link a
referrer reference to help us track our marketing efforts. We don’t track
whether our emails are opened, but are interested in which links get clicked so
we can improve our [selection criteria](selection-criteria/). We also track
which links are clicked on our website.

If you sign up to Jobs Console, we collect your email and information about your
job preferences. We use this to match you with the best jobs. Your profile is
private until you decide to engage with one of the organizations looking to
recruit. If you flag interest in a job we’ve sent you, we pass your profile to
the hiring manager. This is anonymous by default, but if you add any (optional)
extra information such as a blog or other portfolio URL, that will also be sent
and may reveal your identity. We only provide hiring managers with your contact
details once you have both opted to receive them.

You can unsubscribe from all our emails at any time using the link in each email
or by contacting us.

Our newsletter and website contains links to websites and third-parties. If you
follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have
their own privacy policies. Please check these policies before you submit any
personal data to these websites.

That’s the plain English version. Here are the extra details.
