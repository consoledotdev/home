Our goal is to track as little as possible, only collecting what will help us
improve Console. To do that, we want to understand the following metrics:

-   How many visitors have been on our website.
-   Where those visitors are referred from.
-   Which pages they visit.
-   What browser are they using, and whether it is mobile or desktop.
-   How that is trending over time.
-   How many email subscribers we have.
-   Whether the tools we include in our weekly newsletter are interesting.

Using these simple metrics, we can analyse how many people sign up to our
newsletter, which website pages are the most popular (so we can invest more in
those types of page), whether our marketing is working (paid vs organic), and
how we're doing over time. Knowing browser and device type helps us ensure we
test on the right platforms.

We don't need anything more detailed, and certainly don't need or want to track
website visitors on an individual level. We especially want to avoid services
which conduct mass tracking across the internet e.g. Google Analytics, Facebook
Pixel, etc.

If you sign up to our newsletter then we collect your email, and may link a
referrer reference to help us track our marketing efforts. We don't track
whether our emails are opened, but are interested in which links get clicked so
we can improve our selection criteria.

Our newsletter and website contains links to websites and third-parties. If you
follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have
their own privacy policies. Please check these policies before you submit any
personal data to these websites.

On that basis, this is our Privacy Policy:
