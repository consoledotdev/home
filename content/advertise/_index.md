    intro:
      - Slim.AI is a container analysis and comparison tool. Slim.AI approached
        Console to help sign-up early adopters to their developer platform.
        Console worked with their growth team to maximise exposure to our
        audience by offering unique invite codes to incentivize developers.
    quote:
      "“Our campaign with Console was very successful. We saw x5 our usual daily
      rate of acquisition both on the day of the newsletter and in the following
      days. The best thing was how qualified the audience was. We saw new people
      join our Discord community and start engaging, something we rarely see
      through more traditional paid sources. We even had a new application for
      an engineering position as a result of seeing the interview. Console
      really helped us reach exactly the audience we wanted.” <span>Pieter van
      Noordennen, Senior Director, Growth</span>"

          Slim.AI offered the Console audience an exclusive invite code that
          provided early access to the Developer Platform. The invite code was
          promoted alongside their review in the newsletter to encourage the
          Console audience to sign up.

    intro:
      - Liveblocks worked with Console to help deliver their first users as part
        of a coordinated launch for their real-time collaboration API. As well
        as driving sign-ups to their new tool, Console’s launch package also
        provided early industry validation for their API.
    quote:
      "“Launching a new company and a new product is always difficult because
      you have to quickly build credibility when nobody has heard of you.
      Console’s audience knows that their recommendations are independent, so it
      made a big difference to our launch day that Liveblocks could be
      featured.” <span>Guillaume Salles, CTO</span>"

          As part of the launch, Console also published an interview with
          Liveblocks CTO, Guillaume Salles, in the Console newsletter and on our
          website. Helping provide a background to the company for new
          customers, the interview also ranked highly in Google for anyone
          researching the newly launched company.

          their own social media channels as a trusted recommendation for their

  - name: IPInfo
    url: https://ipinfo.io/
    intro:
      - IPInfo is a leading API for IP address metadata lookup. They were
        looking for new channels to reach developers, so worked with Console to
        reach an audience of experienced developers.
    quote:
      "“IPInfo’s API solves quite a specific need, so it is important for us to
      reach developers who can influence decisions, or who have a budget
      themselves. Console’s audience fits that criteria, which is why we were
      interested in incentivizing their audience with an exclusive discount
      code. We often see a long lag between interest and conversion, but have
      already seen new paying customers from our target demographic as a direct
      result of working with Console.” <span>Ben Dowling, CEO</span>"

      - text:
          IPInfo provided the Console audience with a special discount to
          encourage signups. This provided a significant discount on the list
          price for a set period of time. Console ran the code alongside the
          newsletter review to increase click conversions.
      - text:
          To incentivize our audience and deliver new customers, Console worked
          with IPInfo to offer a discount code exclusively available to Console
          subscribers to try out IPInfo for less.

    intro:
      - Oso is a batteries-included framework for building authorization in your
        application.
      - 'To promote a product release, Oso worked with Console to scheduled a
        review, an interview with their CTO, and promotion of a blog post on <a

        class="link">Why Authorization is Hard</a>'
    quote:
      "“Oso is breaking new ground in a complex space (authorization). We're
      creating a new product category, which is a complicated category, so it
      makes it challenging to break it down to developers and explain it to
      them. So we want to be in media, like Console, where developers are
      interested in learning new things. Working with Console, we were able to
      provide the extra context that enabled us to convey how Oso can help. We
      were able to sync our launch dates and coordinate an interview with our
      CTO to provide a primer on the vision, but also deeplink to our developer
      docs. This helped us maximize impact for the launch and reach thousands of
      developers in the right way.” <span>Stephie Glaser, Developer

      Maps. Through Console, we were able to target developer audiences
      naturally attuned to our solution and offer independent insight into
      CodeSee as a company in the Console interview of our CEO, Shanea Leven.
      And the results were solid; the newsletter performed well, and on the day

      engineer is a challenge on its own. Launching a campaign with Console
      helped us achieve this objective: they have the right audience and the
      right format for this. Our experience working with Console was smooth. As

    quote:
      "“Console was a great addition to our latest product launch at Teleport.
      We often appeal to a very technical audience, and Console helped us tap
      into their list of highly qualified subscribers. The Console campaign
      alone drove hundreds of new visitors to our site, with many of them
      engaging across multiple pages. We love that the Console team is committed
      to sharing genuine, objective feedback on the tools they promote, and we
