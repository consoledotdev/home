Test cases for which the requirements are frequently changing or can not be performed by robots (such as solving a CAPTCHA or 3rd party logins) are also executed manually. In live testing, the tester can interact with the website in real time and see how it responds to different inputs.</p>"

It is used to quickly test business critical sections of code before deployment to make sure that new changes do not break existing functionality of the web application. Test cases that are time-consuming, repeatedly executed, very tedious or difficult to perform manually are often automated. In automated testing, the tester can see test results only after the execution of the test is complete.</p>"

Data driven testing is the way to do so. Ideally, test cases are written to ensure that all statements in the program have been executed at least once and that all logical path flows, e.g. if-else blocks and switch statements, have been executed.</p>"

                "text": "<p>Devtools in browsers provide many useful features to test websites whilst in development, particularly early on. The exact features provided vary from browser to browser but some common tools are included in all browsers such as viewing HTML, viewing local storage data/cookies, monitoring network requests and changing viewport sizes. Some browsers also allow detecting memory leaks and accessibility testing. Extensions like <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools-extensions\" class=\"link\">React devtools</a>, <a href=\"https://devtools.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html\" class=\"link\">Vue devtools</a>, etc. can be added to further enhance these testing capabilities.</p><p>Specialist browser testing tools provide sophisticated features not available in everyday browsers such as parallel testing, scheduling automated tests, test report generation and integrations with project management tools. In particular, these tools also provide the ability to test on a large number of operating systems, browsers and mobile devices from various regions in the world. This is not possible with just Chrome or Firefox devtools.</p>"
