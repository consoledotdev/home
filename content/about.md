Discover the best tools and beta releases for developers. {.description}

Console aims to become the place developers go to find the best tools. Starting
as a weekly newsletter, each week we will pick out the most interesting tools
and new releases. **We keep track of everything - dev tools, devops, cloud, and
APIs - so you don't have to.**

Our recommendations are made through years of experience and research, bringing
a deep practical understanding of the needs of experienced developers. **We
pride ourselves on being transparent in our editorial approach.** Itâ€™s our job
to do the filtering, so you can stay up-to-date with the tools that matter, and
focus on what you do best. Building.

{{< div-caption >}} Founders David Mytton & Max Jennings.

David was previously co-founder of server monitoring startup, Server Density. He
built the original version of the product in Python and grew the business to
acquisition in 2018, at which point it was used by hundreds of customers to
collect billions of time series metrics from millions of servers. More recently,
he has been researching sustainable computing at Imperial College London &
Uptime Institute, which
[he continues to do](https://davidmytton.blog/publications/) alongside running
Console.

Max has 20+ years tech experience building online businesses. Previous start-ups
he co-founded have been acquired by Retailmenot Inc, Expedia and GCAP Media.
Most recently he co-founded Hoop, an app that helps UK families discover things
to do with their kids. It was chosen by Apple as App of the Year twice and
installed by over 1.5 million families. {{< /div-caption >}}

### Selection Criteria

Our selection criteria are explained below. The more of these questions we can
answer positively, the more likely a tool is to be featured. We try to be
objective but there is always a subjective element to deciding what we think is
the best, most interesting set of tools each week:

- Is this interesting and useful to developers?
- Is there a self-service signup?
- Would this form part of a daily-use set of developer tools?
- Does it make me a better developer?
- Does it solve a problem I have experienced? How well does it solve it?
- Would this be used by advanced, power-users?
- Is the tool high quality?
- Does it do the job it claims?
- Does it have a good graphical and/or command line interface? Shortcuts?
  Accessibility?
- Is it being actively maintained with regular bug fixes and updates?
- Does it have good documentation? Is it fast?
- Does it have any negative impact on security or privacy?
- How would I feel recommending this to my friends? Would I tweet a link to it?

### Beyond the newsletter

Over time our goal is to **build a community where developers can find the best
tools**. This will include long form research, discussion, and exclusive deals
and/or early access to beta programs and new releases.

We aim to support Console through this last one - partnering with vendors to
connect with our audience, such as by syncing reviews with new releases or
offering exclusives such as access to beta programs or bonus credits. We may be
paid for these. However, our editorial process is independent from our vendor
partnerships. We do not accept payment for product inclusion. Where we feature
exclusive deals from partners, they must first fit our selection criteria before
we consider working with them.

progress. To start, we recommend reading our thoughts on the
'[Age of the Developer](https://blog.console.dev/focusing-on-developers/)'. We
aim to be open and transparent so everyone can
