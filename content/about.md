Discover the best tools and beta releases for developers.
{.description}

Console aims to become the place developers go to find the best tools. Starting
as a weekly newsletter, each week we will pick out the most interesting tools
and new releases. **We keep track of everything - dev tools, devops, cloud, and
APIs - so you don't have to.**

Our recommendations are made through years of experience and research, bringing
a deep practical understanding of the needs of experienced developers. We pride
ourselves on [being transparent in our editorial
approach](/selection-criteria/). Itâ€™s our job to do the filtering, so you can
stay up-to-date with the tools that matter, and focus on what you do best.

### Selection Criteria

Visit the [selection criteria](/selection-criteria/) page to read how to choose
what appears in the Console newsletter each week.

### Beyond the newsletter

Having launched in early-2021, over time our goal is to **build a community of
experienced developers**. This will include reviews of the best developer tools,
profiles of interesting companies, interviews with people building devtools, and
helping developers find the best places to work.

Console generates revenue by [partnering with vendors](/advertise/) to connect
with our audience, such as by syncing reviews with new releases or offering
exclusives such as access to beta programs. We may be paid for these. However,
our editorial process is independent from our vendor partnerships. All partners
must first fit our [selection criteria](/selection-criteria/) before we consider
working with them. The same applies to [the startups we invest in](/zero/).

To learn more about Console, check out the Console blog where you can follow our
progress. To start, we recommend reading our thoughts on the
'[Age of the Developer](https://blog.console.dev/focusing-on-developers/)'. We
aim to be open and transparent so everyone can {{< a-link url="https://github.com/consoledotdev" text="see what we're building" icon-right="github" >}} so we publish
[monthly status updates](https://blog.console.dev/tag/status-update/) about our
progress.
