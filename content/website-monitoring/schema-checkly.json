    "reviewBody": "Checkly is a website monitoring tool built specifically for developers. It has a clean and easy to use UI, but has powerful scripting capabilities so test plans can be written using the Playwright and Puppeteer frameworks. We particularly like the integration with Terraform to define monitoring configuration as code."
