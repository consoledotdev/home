### Cost

Website monitoring plans start at $9/month and go up to $225/month for the
Enterprise plan.

{{< vendor-review/feature-title text="Check types & frequency" score="5" >}}

Site24x7 can monitor APIs (REST and SOAP), WebSockets, DNS, TCP, UDP, POP, SMTP,
FTP, and NTP. A particularly interesting feature is the ability to run tests
using 3G/4G/5G networks, thereby simulating real-world mobile connectivity.
Site24x7 can also check against popular block lists, and the expiration of
domain or TLS certificates. Synthetic Monitoring and Real User Monitoring are
also supported.

Check frequency varies between 30 seconds and 1 day, but only using predefined
values with the 30 second check interval available on the higher “Elite” and
“Enterprise” plans.

{{< vendor-review/feature-title text="Check locations" score="4" >}}

Site24x7 provides more than
[110+ check locations](https://www.site24x7.com/multi-location-web-site-monitoring.html)
around the world. Locations are well scattered across the globe and cover all
regions except Africa and north-eastern Asia. A specific monitor can have a
maximum of 8 locations (16 for enterprise plans). Private check locations are
supported (on Windows and Linux) and it is possible to install an
[application on mobile](https://www.site24x7.com/mobile-monitoring.html) devices
in order to use them as a check location - particularly useful for checking
cellular networks.

{{< framed-section-item--open >}}

{{< vendor-review/feature-title text="Multi-step requests" score="4.5" >}}

Multi-step requests for transaction monitoring can be generated either by using
a browser extension or by creating a Selenium script. It is possible to record
and play back multi-step user interactions via a real browser on private
networks using the on-premise poller. APIs can be tested using multi-step HTTP
requests that use the response from the last request for creating the next
request.

{{< vendor-review/feature-title text="Alerts" score="4" >}}

Two different kinds of alerts are supported by Site24x7 - “trouble” and “down”.
These different states are triggered when certain parameters are fulfilled, such
as response string headers, specific HTTP status codes, and timeouts. It is also
possible to detect unexpected website changes and loading delays by setting
thresholds for response times to detect performance regressions.

{{< rich-title-3 icon="like" >}}What we like{{</ rich-title-3 >}}

Site24x7 supports a range of protocols to validate websites and the associated
services are operating normally. Additionally, it can monitor arbitrary ports
(using TCP/UDP),
[ISP latency](https://www.site24x7.com/community/obtain-visibility-across-the-internet-with-isp-latency-monitoring)
(analyzes connectivity and performance at every hop of the network), and
WebSockets (useful to monitor real-time apps like live chat software), REST and
SOAP API endpoints Assertions can be badefined to validate responses using
JSONPath or XPath.

Site24x7 offers more check locations than Datadog (16), Checkly (21), and New
Relic (20) combined. Availability of 110+ check locations makes it possible to
monitor the website from all regions of the world rather than a few major
cities. This range of locations is only possible with alternative tools if a
private check location is used. It is possible to
[integrate an AWS account](https://www.site24x7.com/help/aws/advanced-configurations.html)
to sync resource info, for example, metadata of EC2 instances can be synced and
alerts can be issued when there is an outage at AWS' end.

Site24x7 provides an
[On-Premise Poller](https://www.site24x7.com/help/getting-started/on-premise-poller.html)
for Windows and Linux operating systems, a tool that can be used to monitor
internal endpoints or run tests against websites on the internet to supplement
the already available check locations. One feature that stands out amongst
competitors is that Site24x7 has a mobile application available for Android
devices to
[run checks via carrier networks](https://www.site24x7.com/mobile-monitoring.html).
This turns the phone into a new monitoring location that can run checks like any
other location. This innovative feature is unique to Site24x7 - it is not
offered by any other tool.

[Browser tests](https://www.site24x7.com/help/admin/adding-a-monitor/webapplication-monitoring-realbrowser.html)
can be performed by recording interactions using a web extension (available for
Chrome, Firefox, and Edge). These web transactions can be played-back using
Selenium. Users can modify steps using the web transaction recorder at a later
point in time or directly import Selenium scripts ('.side' format).

Users can design a custom dashboard to display useful metrics, charts and graphs
on the dashboard that can be rearranged or resized as needed. The dashboard
metrics can be shared with stakeholders by exporting as a PDF file or published
publicly. Public dashboards are responsively designed to adapt to all screen
sizes and are well-suited to display metrics on a big screen in the office.
Public status pages that contain the current status of components and incident
history can also be set-up. These pages provide the option to subscribe to
updates about ongoing incidents or upcoming maintenance via email, SMS,
iCalendar feed, and RSS feed.

Admins can set up alert groups and manage on-call schedules of different team
members to notify relevant people in the event of an outage. Users can receive
alerts via SMS, voice calls and push notifications (via a mobile application on
Android and iOS devices). Amazon EventBridge, Moogsoft, Jira, ConnectWise
Manage, PagerDuty, Slack, Zapier, Microsoft Teams, multiple ManageEngine tools,
ServiceNow, and OpsGenie can be integrated with Site24x7 to receive incident
alerts. Webhooks can also be configured.

{{< rich-title-3 icon="dislike" >}}What we don't like{{</ rich-title-3 >}}

A major downside to Site24x7 is that the functionality has outgrown the UI
design. The UX feels very busy, which makes it difficult to get started. The
website, server, cloud, network, and application monitoring features are all
built into the same dashboard which means there is a lot of text - this makes it
powerful, but difficult to use. Some parts of the dashboard are poorly aligned
and have improper margins/padding. This does not affect its functionality, but
damages the overall experience.

Site24x7's documentation is split between
[help](https://www.site24x7.com/help/overview.html), an
[API guide](https://www.site24x7.com/help/api/) and a
[knowledge base](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/site24x7/) which also
seem to have outgrown their size. Datadog and New Relic's documentation is
vastly superior and regularly updated - anyone can suggest changes on GitHub,
which is a common approach for more modern devtools products.

An example of this outdated approach is demonstrated by how the
[On-premise poller](https://www.site24x7.com/help/admin/adding-a-monitor/on-premise-poller.html)
is implemented - the Linux version has a GUI based installer and requires sudo
privileges. This is unusual as most people would only use the CLI version on
servers, particularly on Linux. Sysadmins would not like the idea of running a
third party application with root privileges on a server. Alternatives to
Site24x7 like New Relic and Datadog use a Docker container.

This lack of attention to implementation detail means there is a concern about
the overall quality of the service.
