Console's mission is to help developers find the best tools. As part of that, we
angel invest in developer-first startups who meet [our selection
criteria](/selection-criteria/) and [stand out amongst all the other
devtools](https://blog.console.dev/devtools-startups-standing-out-to-investors/).

Console has a large audience of experienced developers who trust us to provide
recommendations about the tools they should try out. If we'd feature the tool in
the newsletter, we'd also consider investing.

Our pitch is simple - access to our community of experienced developers to get
in front of early users, hire your early team, and get advice through our
connections within the developer community.

With [years of experience](/about/) running venture backed startups building
software products for technical audiences, we can bring a deep practical
understanding of the needs of experienced developers.

We believe that [the age of the
developer](https://blog.console.dev/focusing-on-developers/) is only just
getting started. The massive growth in software development has been mirrored by
an equally massive growth in the opportunity for developer tools.

So if you're building something that would be a fit for our audience [get in
