As part of our mission to help developers find the best tools, we regularly
speak to early stage startups. Whilst it has never been easier to get started
writing code, it has never been harder to reach developers.

We can help with that.

Console has a large audience of experienced developers who trust us to provide
recommendations about the tools they should try out. We're working with
[advertising partners](/advertise/) to reach that audience, but we are also
investing in early stage startups that meet
[our selection criteria](/selection-criteria/) to help build the next generation
of developer tools. If we'd feature the tool in the newsletter, we'd also
consider investing.

Through our separate, independent legal entity, Console Zero, and led by Console
co-founder, [David Mytton](https://davidmytton.blog/about/), we are already an
investor in multiple early stage startups in Europe and US.

Our pitch is that through the Console audience we can help you find your first
users and launch your product to the world. With
[our years of experience](/about/) running venture backed startups building
software products for technical audiences, we can bring a deep practical
understanding of the needs of experienced developers.

We believe that
[the age of the developer](https://blog.console.dev/focusing-on-developers/) is
only just getting started. The massive growth in software development has been
mirrored by an equally massive growth in the market for developer tools.

So if you're building something that would be a fit for our audience
