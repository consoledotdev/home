Console is the place developers go to find the best tools.

Our weekly newsletter picks out the most interesting tools and new releases and
is read by experienced developers at organizations around the world. Whether big
public companies, government agencies, startups or small businesses, developers
subscribe our [newsletter](/latest/), listen our
[podcast](https://podcast.console.dev/) and read our [category reviews](/tools/)
to find out which new and interesting tools they should try.

We partner with vendors who want to connect with our audience, such as by
syncing reviews with new releases or offering exclusives such as access to beta
programs or bonus credits.

Our editorial process is independent from our vendor partnerships. We do not
accept payment for product inclusion. Where we feature exclusive deals from
partners, they must first fit our
[selection criteria](/about/#selection-criteria) before we consider working with
them.

If you are interested in working with us, please
[get in touch](mailto:hello@console.dev).
