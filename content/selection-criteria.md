Console is the place to discover the best tools and beta releases for
developers. We're always trying out new tools - whether brand new releases,
updates, or things we've rediscovered - but we only feature the best. This page
explains our selection criteria for how we choose.

### Interesting tools

Each week we feature and review 2-3 interesting developer tools in the Console
[newsletter](/newsletter/) and [on our website](/tools/).

Our selection criteria are explained below. The more of these questions we can
answer positively, the more likely a tool is to be featured. We try to be
objective but there is always a subjective element to deciding what we think is
the best, most interesting set of tools each week:

- Is this interesting and useful to developers?
- Is the primary user a developer? A developer might use it, but is it built
  specifically with developers in mind?
- Is there a self-service signup? A demo or speaking to sales may be an option,
  but an individual developer must be able to try it themselves without speaking
  to anyone.
- Would this form part of a regular-use set of developer tools? Does it fit into
  the development cycle? Is it a part of the development flow?
- Does it make me a better developer? Does it help me reduce/manage bugs,
  improve build times, get code to production faster, reduce/manage errors, etc?
- Would this be used by advanced power-users? Does it support dark mode, is
  there an API and/or CLI, are there keyboard shortcuts, what about
  accessibility?
- Is the tool high quality? Does it work on multiple platforms and/or browsers?
  Is it easy to install/deploy? Does it do the job it claims?
- Is it being actively maintained with regular bug fixes and updates?
- Does it have good documentation? Is it fast?
- Does it have any negative impact on security or privacy?
- How would I feel recommending this to my friends? Would I tweet a link to it?

### DevTools jobs

Each month we feature 3 devtools companies in the Console
[newsletter](/newsletter/) who are hiring for technical roles. We feature
companies rather than specific jobs, and apply the following criteria to
determine whether a company is eligible to be featured or not - not all are
required, but the more the better:s

- Is the company building services and/or products where the primary user is a
  developer?
- Are there challenging problems to solve? Is that because it's a new startup
  building something interesting and/or because the code is deployed at scale?
- How is the company contributing to open source? Is the product itself open
  source? Do they have an open source program?
- How detailed is the careers website? Do I get a real sense of what it would be
  like to work there?
- How public is the company about their technology? Do they have an active blog
  explaining how they've solved interesting problems? Are team members active
  online (blog, social media, video) talking about it?
- What are the HR policies like? Is remote work allowed? What is the office
  culture like? Are they transparent about benefits?
- How well does the product meet the "Interesting tools" criteria above?
- Is the organization financially secure? What does the revenue, profit,
  donations and/or funding situation look like?

### Sponsors

[Console works with vendors](/advertise/) who want to reach our audience of
experienced developers. We pride ourselves on being transparent in our editorial
approach and all potential partners must meet the above selection criteria
before we will work with them.
