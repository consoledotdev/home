Console is the place to discover the best tools and beta releases for
developers. We're always trying out new tools - whether brand new releases,
updates, or things we've rediscovered - but we only feature the best. This page
explains our selection criteria for how we choose.

### Interesting tools

Each week we feature and review 2-3 interesting developer tools in the Console
[newsletter](/newsletter/) and [on our website](/tools/).

Our selection criteria are explained below. The more of these questions we can
answer positively, the more likely a tool is to be featured. We try to be
objective but there is always a subjective element to deciding what we think is
the best, most interesting set of tools each week:

- Is this interesting and useful to developers?
- Is the primary user a developer? A developer might use it, but is it built
  specifically with developers in mind?
- Is there a self-service signup? A demo or speaking to sales may be an option,
  but an individual developer must be able to try it themselves without speaking
  to anyone.
- Would this form part of a regular-use set of developer tools? Does it fit into
  the development cycle? Is it a part of the development flow?
- Does it make me a better developer? Does it help me reduce/manage bugs,
  improve build times, get code to production faster, reduce/manage errors, etc?
- Would this be used by advanced power-users? Does it support dark mode, is
  there an API and/or CLI, are there keyboard shortcuts, what about
  accessibility?
- Is the tool high quality? Does it work on multiple platforms and/or browsers?
  Is it easy to install/deploy? Does it do the job it claims?
- Is it being actively maintained with regular bug fixes and updates?
- Does it have good documentation? Is it fast?
- Does it have any negative impact on security or privacy?
- How would I feel recommending this to my friends? Would I tweet a link to it?

### Sponsors

[Console works with vendors](/advertise/) who want to reach our audience of
experienced developers. We pride ourselves on being transparent in our editorial
approach and all potential partners must meet the above selection criteria
before we will work with them.
