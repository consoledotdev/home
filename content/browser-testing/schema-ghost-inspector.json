    "reviewBody": "Ghost Inspector is a great tool for getting started with desktop browser testing. Some common features such as extensive browser support and live testing are missing or limited, but it provides enough power to new users to run complex end-to-end tests without overwhelming them. Ghost Inspector only supports desktop browsers - mobile testing is not possible."
