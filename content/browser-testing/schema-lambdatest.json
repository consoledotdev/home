    "reviewBody": "LambdaTest offers automated cross-browser tests on a large number of devices ranging from the earliest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera on Windows XP and macOS Lion to the latest versions on Windows 11 and macOS Monterey across multiple platforms. However, the slow rollout of the new OS and device releases and the absence of real devices in the testing cloud is something to look out for."
