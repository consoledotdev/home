intro:
  "SmartBear CrossBrowserTesting provides both automated and live tests across
  multiple platforms and devices going back to Windows XP and iOS 4. The large
  number of integrations and frameworks makes it particularly powerful, but it 
  is limited by high test latency and the lack of accessibility testing 
  features."

{{< vendor-review/feature-title text="Device & browser support" score="4.5" >}}

CrossBrowserTesting offers a good selection of desktop and mobile devices to
choose from. All the versions of Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS ranging from
Windows 11 to Windows XP, “macOS 11.0” to “Mac OSX 10.10”, Android 11 to
Android 4.2, and iOS 14.0 to iOS 4.3.3 respectively are available. On desktop,
each OS is available with different browsers (approximately 50 versions of
each) and display resolutions (800x480 to 2560x1920). On older Android devices,
less popular browsers like Opera Mobile and UC Browser are also available. Only
mobile Safari is available for most iOS devices but Chrome is supported on more
recent iPhones.

CrossBrowserTesting integrates with a vast set of tools which makes it
possible to create complex workflows.
[Integrations](https://support.smartbear.com/crossbrowsertesting/docs/integrations/index.html)
with CI/CD tools (Jenkins CI, TeamCity, VS Team Services, etc.) and testing
services (Lighthouse, TestComplete, Katalon Studio, etc.) are available.
Testing frameworks such as TestNG, NUnit, Mocha, Jest, Cucumber, Jasmine, etc.
are also supported. CrossBrowserTesting provides a powerful
[API](https://support.smartbear.com/crossbrowsertesting/docs/api.html) that
enables customizing website-testing workflows and allows implementing browser
testing services via HTTP. Any action which can be performed via dashboard can
also be performed via an API endpoint.

{{< vendor-review/feature-title text="Debugging & error reporting" score="4" >}}

CrossBrowserTesting allows adding notes and tags to test reports - this makes
it easier to filter test reports and share. Test reports can be shared in bulk
with team members via a public link, Slack, Jira, or email.

All test executions show test steps with relevant details like execution logs,
detailed network logs, video recordings and screenshots. This makes
understanding the results and debugging process easier.

{{< rich-title-3 icon="like" >}}What we like{{</ rich-title-3 >}}

CrossBrowserTesting offers visual testing services for identifying
inconsistencies in user experience across devices. An automated screenshot tool
allows capturing screenshots on a large number of desktop and mobile browsers.
It can perform regression testing to identify layout differences against a
baseline run.

Tests can be scheduled to run on set intervals or triggered from either
dashboard or API. Advanced configuration can be set up to perform actions like
HTTP authentication, form login, waiting for a set duration, executing a
Selenium script before capturing screenshots, etc. Multiple screenshot tests
are run concurrently which reduces wait time and it is possible to run tests on
locally hosted websites.

{{< img-custom class="content-image" src="/img/browser-testing/crossbrowsertesting-live-testing.png" alt="Screenshot of Live testing tool with SmartBear CrossBrowserTesting." >}}
{{< a--close >}}

Results from the test can be notified via email or can be sent to Applitools
for inspection. Live testing sessions (with identical testing configuration)
can be launched with one click from the screenshot test reports to quickly
interact with malfunctioning interfaces.

Standout features offered by CrossBrowserTesting include:

- Support for uncommon browsers like Opera Mini, Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge Mobile, etc.
- A vast number of [real devices](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/real-devices) are available for live interaction.
- Remote developer tools are available for debugging.
- Screenshots, videos & logs can be accessed after testing.
- Network logs for each request are displayed in an easy-to-understand gantt chart to identify performance bottlenecks.

Some of the features mentioned above are not available in the [alternative
browser testing tools we tested](/browser-testing/). For example,
[BrowserStack](/browser-testing/browserstack/) does not provide test reports for
live tests, [LambdaTest](/browser-testing/lambdatest/) does not offer real
devices (currently in beta), and [Ghost
Inspector](/browser-testing/ghost-inspector/) and
[Selenium](/browser-testing/selenium/) do not support live testing at all.

The record & replay feature allows recording website interactions and replaying
them as tests without touching a single line of code. Tests can be combined to
build suites, which can then be replayed or scheduled to do "automated-manual"
testing. This feature performs on par with similar offerings by other vendors
such as [Ghost Inspector Web Test
Recorder](https://ghostinspector.com/docs/test-recorder/) and [Selenium
IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/).

Remote testing servers can be connected to local machines (via a secure web
socket tunnel) or any proxy service to test websites behind a firewall without
needing to expose them to the internet. It is also possible to share a directory
on a local machine with read-only access to testing servers. Local tunnels can
be established via [Chrome
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crossbrowsertesting-local/ldabplgpogjknofonmccpbgeoolbcbfm),
[NodeJS module](https://github.com/crossbrowsertesting/cbt-tunnel-nodejs),
desktop application, or the command line.

CrossBrowserTesting does not provide solutions to perform automated
accessibility testing. The [Lighthouse
report](https://support.smartbear.com/crossbrowsertesting/docs/integrations/lighthouse.html)
generated during screenshot testing has a section on accessibility, but nothing
more is offered. This came as a surprise because it is a basic feature and is
already present in mainstream browsers such as Chrome. Specialized browser
testing tools should provide more advanced, feature-rich solutions for
accessibility testing.

When compared to other tools, network latency during live testing is high.
Having to wait >1 second on average for each keystroke to appear on screen
while typing is unreasonable and makes testing a tedious task. This issue is
even worse when using a tunnel or a proxy to test locally. During live testing,
sound is available, but it has a low bitrate quality.

CrossBrowserTesting used to provide an option to perform functional testing on
headless browsers on Ubuntu - this feature has since been silently removed. We
also found that the latest macOS and iPhone devices announced in September 2021
are still not available in February 2022. On older iOS devices, only Safari is
supported. Chrome is available only on a few recently released iPhones.

Testing localization settings of websites are not possible directly - all
testing traffic originates from servers in the US. Users can [set up a
proxy](https://support.smartbear.com/crossbrowsertesting/docs/live-testing/test-geo-located-content.html)
that routes all testing traffic from the desired location, however this induces
unnecessary overhead and additional costs.

We encountered some issues with the record & playback functionality. Tests
generated are not perfect and sometimes need to be corrected by the tester
before they can be used. We discovered that any scroll action performed during
recording is recorded as `Scroll to (0,0)` and using a laptop trackpad resulted
in sporadic clicks. Tests generated by this method can not be exported or used
anywhere else, thereby enforcing a vendor lock-in. Ghost Inspector Web Test
Recorder, a competing product, allows exporting tests in Selenium IDE format -
this makes it possible to store tests alongside code and execute them anywhere.
