{{< rich-title-3 icon="checklist" id="how-engineering-works" >}} How engineering
works at Vantage{{</ rich-title-3 >}}

#### How are the teams structured?

We have a fairly flat organization given the size of the team. All engineering,
product and design report into Brooke McKim, Co-Founder and CTO. Sales,
marketing and customer success functions report into Ben Schaechter, Co-Founder
and CEO.

#### What tools do engineers use?

Tools we use at Vantage include Docker, Ruby, Rails, Slack, Notion, Git, Github,
Github Issues, Github Actions, Sentry, ngrok, Datadog.

#### Can developers pick their own tools?

Yes, for the most part! We try to maintain some consistency across the
organization but look to developers to make recommendations.

#### How does the development process work? What's the process for working through bugs, features and tech debt?

We have a well-defined product spec review process which engineers participate
in. From that product spec being finalized, development efforts begin and we
have weekly product check-ins until a feature is launched. As for bugs, they’re
typically opened and tracked via Github issues and remediated by the engineer
working on that specific part of the code. Given the nascent stage of the
company, we don’t have a tremendous amount of tech debt and most effort is spent
on feature development.

#### How does code get reviewed, merged, and deployed?

We have a standard process around pull requests where any major change should be
opened via pull request and reviewed by at least one other team-member before
deploying to either staging or production depending on the impact of the change
going out. Ideally, there would be a set of accompanying tests that pass as part
of major logic changes.

#### What is the QA process?

At a minimum we have an internal team QA process and for most features we can
dogfood them ourselves internally before exposing them to customers. For certain
features, we do run an “early access” period where we can get feedback as well.
It is a fairly light, casual process for now that will become more thorough over
time.

#### What are some recent examples of interesting development challenges solved by internal teams as part of building the product?

We have some fairly significant scale when it comes to data and we recently
transitioned over our entire data processing pipeline to leverage a data
warehouse as our database was under considerable pressure. We are now seamlessly
processing terabytes of data representing hundreds of millions of annualized
dollars for our customers.

#### How does the application process work? What are the stages and what is the timeline?

Send a note with your resume to jobs@vantage.sh which will be read by our
Co-Founder and CTO. We’ll schedule an initial 30 minute conversation and if it
seems like a mutual fit, there will be two technical interviews and a final
interview with our Co-Founder and CEO. Upon references being checked, an offer
will be extended. Typically this entire process can be done in 1-2 weeks.

#### What is the career progression framework? How are promotions and performance reviews managed?

The company is a seed stage company so by nature of the company growing and
expanding it is expected that existing team-members will have considerable
career progression as things grow and evolve. We have an annual performance
review process that happens in April of each year.
